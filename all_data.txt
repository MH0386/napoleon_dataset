napoleon bonaparte (1769-1821), also known as napoleon i, was a french military leader and emperor who conquered much of europe in the early 19th century.born on the island of corsica, napoleon rapidly rose through the ranks of the military during the french revolution (1789-1799).after seizing political power in france in a 1799 coup d'état, he crowned himself emperor in 1804.shrewd, ambitious and a skilled military strategist, napoleon successfully waged war against various coalitions of european nations and expanded his empire.however, after a disastrous french invasion of russia in 1812, napoleon abdicated the throne two years later and was exiled to the island of elba.in 1815, he briefly returned to power in his hundred days campaign.after a crushing defeat at the battle of waterloo, he abdicated once again and was exiled to the remote island of saint helena, where he died at 51.
napoleon bonaparte was born on august 15, 1769, in ajaccio, on the mediterranean island of corsica.he was the second of eight surviving children born to carlo buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and letizia romalino buonaparte (1750-1836).although his parents were members of the minor corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy.the year before napoleon's birth, france acquired corsica from the city-state of genoa, italy.napoleon later adopted a french spelling of his last name.
as a boy, napoleon attended school in mainland france, where he learned the french language, and went on to graduate from a french military academy in 1785.he then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the french army.the french revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a french republic.during the early years of the revolution, napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in corsica, where he became affiliated with the jacobins, a pro-democracy political group.in 1793, following a clash with the nationalist corsican governor, pasquale paoli (1725-1807), the bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland france, where napoleon returned to military duty.
in france, napoleon became associated with augustin robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader maximilien robespierre (1758-1794), a jacobin who was a key force behind the reign of terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution.during this time, napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army.however, after robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with augustin) in july 1794, napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers.
in 1795, napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in paris and was promoted to major general.
in 1799, during napoleon's military campaign in egypt, a french soldier named pierre francois bouchard (1772-1832) discovered the rosetta stone.this artifact provided the key to cracking the code of egyptian hieroglyphics, a written language that had been dead for almost 2,000 years.
since 1792, france's revolutionary government had been engaged in military conflicts with various european nations.in 1796, napoleon commanded a french army that defeated the larger armies of austria, one of his country's primary rivals, in a series of battles in italy.in 1797, france and austria signed the treaty of campo formio, resulting in territorial gains for the french.
the following year, the directory, the five-person group that had governed france since 1795, offered to let napoleon lead an invasion of england.napoleon determined that france's naval forces were not yet ready to go up against the superior british royal navy.instead, he proposed an invasion of egypt in an effort to wipe out british trade routes with india.napoleon's troops scored a victory against egypt's military rulers, the mamluks, at the battle of the pyramids in july 1798; soon, however, his forces were stranded after his naval fleet was nearly decimated by the british at the battle of the nile in august 1798.in early 1799, napoleon's army launched an invasion of ottoman empire-ruled syria, which ended with a failed siege of acre, located in modern-day israel.that summer, with the political situation in france marked by uncertainty, the ever-ambitious and cunning napoleon opted to abandon his army in egypt and return to france.
in november 1799, in an event known as the coup of 18 brumaire, napoleon was part of a group that successfully overthrew the french directory.
the directory was replaced with a three-member consulate, and 5'7" napoleon became first consul, making him france's leading political figure.in june 1800, at the battle of marengo, napoleon's forces defeated one of france's perennial enemies, the austrians, and drove them out of italy.the victory helped cement napoleon's power as first consul.additionally, with the treaty of amiens in 1802, the war-weary british agreed to peace with the french (although the peace would only last for a year).
napoleon worked to restore stability to post-revolutionary france.he centralized the government; instituted reforms in such areas as banking and education; supported science and the arts; and sought to improve relations between his regime and the pope (who represented france's main religion, catholicism), which had suffered during the revolution.one of his most significant accomplishments was the napoleonic code, which streamlined the french legal system and continues to form the foundation of french civil law to this day.
in 1802, a constitutional amendment made napoleon first consul for life.two years later, in 1804, he crowned himself emperor of france in a lavish ceremony at the cathedral of notre dame in paris.
in 1796, napoleon married josephine de beauharnais (1763-1814), a stylish widow six years his senior who had two teenage children.more than a decade later, in 1809, after napoleon had no offspring of his own with empress josephine, he had their marriage annulled so he could find a new wife and produce an heir.in 1810, he wed marie louise (1791-1847), the daughter of the emperor of austria.the following year, she gave birth to their son, napoleon françois joseph charles bonaparte (1811-1832), who became known as napoleon ii and was given the title king of rome.in addition to his son with marie louise, napoleon had several illegitimate children.
from 1803 to 1815, france was engaged in the napoleonic wars, a series of major conflicts with various coalitions of european nations.in 1803, partly as a means to raise funds for future wars, napoleon sold france's louisiana territory in north america to the newly independent united states for $15 million, a transaction that later became known as the louisiana purchase.
in october 1805, the british wiped out napoleon's fleet at the battle of trafalgar.however, in december of that same year, napoleon achieved what is considered to be one of his greatest victories at the battle of austerlitz, in which his army defeated the austrians and russians.the victory resulted in the dissolution of the holy roman empire and the creation of the confederation of the rhine.
beginning in 1806, napoleon sought to wage large-scale economic warfare against britain with the establishment of the so-called continental system of european port blockades against british trade.in 1807, following napoleon's defeat of the russians at friedland in prussia, alexander i (1777-1825) was forced to sign a peace settlement, the treaty of tilsit.in 1809, the french defeated the austrians at the battle of wagram, resulting in further gains for napoleon.
during these years, napoleon reestablished a french aristocracy (eliminated in the french revolution) and began handing out titles of nobility to his loyal friends and family as his empire continued to expand across much of western and central continental europe.
in 1810, russia withdrew from the continental system.in retaliation, napoleon led a massive army into russia in the summer of 1812.rather than engaging the french in a full-scale battle, the russians adopted a strategy of retreating whenever napoleon's forces attempted to attack.as a result, napoleon's troops trekked deeper into russia despite being ill-prepared for an extended campaign.
in september, both sides suffered heavy casualties in the indecisive battle of borodino.napoleon's forces marched on to moscow, only to discover almost the entire population evacuated.retreating russians set fires across the city in an effort to deprive enemy troops of supplies.after waiting a month for a surrender that never came, napoleon, faced with the onset of the russian winter, was forced to order his starving, exhausted army out of moscow.during the disastrous retreat, his army suffered continual harassment from a suddenly aggressive and merciless russian army.of napoleon's 600,000 troops who began the campaign, only an estimated 100,000 made it out of russia.
at the same time as the catastrophic russian invasion, french forces were engaged in the peninsular war (1808-1814), which resulted in the spanish and portuguese, with assistance from the british, driving the french from the iberian peninsula.this loss was followed in 1813 by the battle of leipzig, also known as the battle of nations, in which napoleon's forces were defeated by a coalition that included austrian, prussian, russian and swedish troops.napoleon then retreated to france, and in march 1814 coalition forces captured paris.
on april 6, 1814, napoleon, then in his mid-40s, was forced to abdicate the throne.with the treaty of fontainebleau, he was exiled to elba, a mediterranean island off the coast of italy.he was given sovereignty over the small island, while his wife and son went to austria.
on february 26, 1815, after less than a year in exile, napoleon escaped elba and sailed to the french mainland with a group of more than 1,000 supporters.on march 20, he returned to paris, where he was welcomed by cheering crowds.the new king, louis xviii (1755-1824), fled, and napoleon began what came to be known as his hundred days campaign.
upon napoleon's return to france, a coalition of allies–the austrians, british, prussians and russians–who considered the french emperor an enemy began to prepare for war.napoleon raised a new army and planned to strike preemptively, defeating the allied forces one by one before they could launch a united attack against him.
in june 1815, his forces invaded belgium, where british and prussian troops were stationed.on june 16, napoleon's troops defeated the prussians at the battle of ligny.however, two days later, on june 18, at the battle of waterloo near brussels, the french were crushed by the british, with assistance from the prussians.
on june 22, 1815, napoleon was once again forced to abdicate.
in october 1815, napoleon was exiled to the remote, british-held island of saint helena, in the south atlantic ocean.he died there on may 5, 1821, at age 51, most likely from stomach cancer.(during his time in power, napoleon often posed for paintings with his hand in his vest, leading to some speculation after his death that he had been plagued by stomach pain for years.) napoleon was buried on the island despite his request to be laid to rest "on the banks of the seine, among the french people i have loved so much".in 1840, his remains were returned to france and entombed in a crypt at les invalides in paris, where other french military leaders are interred.
the facts about napoleon bonaparte's life his awesome military achievements against the united powers of europe, his sweeping reforms of law and bureaucracy across an entire continentare extraordinary.but napoleon bonaparte's final years were just as extraordinary, with humiliating exile, a mysterious death at age 51, and a bizarre postmortem chain of events.
after napoleon was finally defeated at the battle of waterloo in 1815, he abdicated his throne and surrendered to the british.rather than execute him and potentially turn him into a martyr, the british placed him in exile on one of the most isolated places on earththe british-held island of saint helena in the south atlantic ocean.
a tiny island measuring only about 10 by 5 miles, its jagged cliffs must have seemed a grim sight when the former emperor first laid eyes on it.after initially enjoying two pleasant months living at the home of a former friend william balcombe, napoleon was then moved to nearby longwood house, a property that had fallen into disrepair, and which was particularly damp and riddled with mold.
his servants were said to have complained of "colds, catarrhs, damp floors and poor provisions".one of the entourage of 28 people who accompanied napoleon was the comte de las cases, who described longwood house as "a wretched hovel, a few feet square".
the island also appears to have been infested with rats, a feature that political satirists from all over europe took as an opportunity to poke fun at the vanquished former emperor.a german political cartoon from the period mocked his situation, with a battalion of rats serving him instead of courtiers.a french cartoon showed the former emperor sleeping in a tent while rats on the shore plot a rebellionthe caption read "not even the rats want him".
it would only get worse.the new british governor of the island, hudson lowe, was determined that napoleon would not escape from this exile as he had done from his first one in elba, and so restricted his movement, monitoring his correspondence, and ordering that napoleon be seen in the flesh by british officers several times a day.
this led to the ex-emperor going into a bizarre form of rebellion, closing the shutters of the house and carving tiny peepholes into them so that he could look out without being seen.he also designed sunken pathways in the garden to make it harder for the officers to spot him.and despite lowe's orders that gifts were not permitted if they made mention of napoleon's imperial status, the former emperor continued to preserve royal protocol, with men in military dress and women in bejewelled gowns.
he also took up a few pastimes: he dictated his memoirs, wrote a book on julius caesar, studied english, and played cards.in fact, he played cards so much that a range of versions of solitaire (the card game also known as "patience") have been named after him.
eventually, the living conditionsand especially his lack of exercisebegan to take their toll, and napoleon's health began to decline precipitously.he suffered from abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting and overall weakness.by february 1821, about four years after his arrival on st helena, napoleon knew his end was nigh.he reconciled with the catholic church after a most tumultuous relationship (which had included at one point kidnapping the pope), and made his confession and took the final sacraments.on may 5, 1821 he passed away at age 51.
shortly after napoleon died, an autopsy was carried out by his physician francesco antommarchi.during this procedure, his heart and intestines were removed and put into sealed vessels, a standard treatment for the bodies of monarchs.however, antommarchi also cut off napoleon's penisno one knows why.
it was then smuggled out of the island by his chaplain and would end up being bought and sold over the years by various parties, eventually ending up on display in 1927 at new york city's museum of french art, where time magazine compared it to a "maltreated strip of buckskin shoelace".an inglorious end for one who had in a matter of years managed to conquer almost all of europe.
so what killed "old bony", as the english liked to call him? that has been the matter of historical debate and medical science for the last 200 years.
antommarchi said it was stomach cancer.in 1961, a swedish amateur toxicologist claimed that napoleon had in fact been poisoned with arsenic and pointed the finger at one of his french entourage.
other researchers have pointed out that, in that era, arsenic was found in a range of materials in daily use and people were constantly exposed to it.yet others have claimed it was either a peptic ulcer or gastric cancer.whatever the true cause, fascination with this extraordinary historical figure shows no sign of waning.
napoleon bonaparte was one of the most successful generals of the french revolutionary armies.he was emperor of france from 1804-14, and in 1815.
napoleon bonaparte (1768-1821) is regarded as one of history's greatest military leaders.born on 15 august 1769, napoleon was educated at military school in france.he then joined the army where, following the outbreak of the french revolution, he rapidly rose through the ranks.
by 1796 he was commander of the french army and, in an attempt to disrupt british trade routes with india, he conquered ottoman-ruled egypt in 1798, despite the fact the british destroyed the fleet from which he had just landed his forces, in the action called the battle of the nile.
returning to france a heroic leader in 1799, napoleon became the country's ‘first consul', going on to become emperor in 1804.
in 1800, at the battle of marengo, napoleon defeated the austrians, thus establishing france's power over continental europe.his sole opponent was britain.
the peace of amiens was signed in 1802, marking the end of the french revolutionary war.britain, isolated from her allies, agreed to return territorial conquests to france, spain and holland.but by may 1803 the treaty had collapsed because britain refused to evacuate malta and napoleon failed to guarantee dutch independence.britain again declared war on france, later followed by austria and russia.
napoleon planned an ambitious scheme to invade england in 1804.he stationed 150,000 men and 2000 vessels at boulogne with the intention of crossing the english channel.part of the plan involved distracting the british navy by encouraging them to chase the french fleet, under the command of vice-admiral villeneuve, from toulon to the west indies, then back to france, thus clearing the channel for invasion.
the british got wind of the plan and attacked the returning villeneuve off cape finisterre.although not a decisive victory, the british forced the franco-spanish fleet to retreat away from the channel and napoleon abandoned his invasion plans.
the british went on to successfully attack the franco-spanish fleet at trafalgar in 1805.by then, however, napoleon was re-focusing his efforts on attacking austro-russian forces, successfully beating them later that year in austerlitz.he went on to defeat the prussians at jena and aurstadt in 1806 and the russians at eylau and friedland in 1807.this earned him greatly expanded territories and a stranglehold over most of europe.
determined to destroy britain, he imposed the ‘continental blockade' in order to stop british european trade.britain retaliated by preventing any trade entering europe by sea.
after 1808, there was popular resistance to the french occupation of portugal and spain.british forces under the duke of wellington began to make headway on the iberian peninsula.napoleon overstretched his empire with the 1812 russian campaign, losing over 500,000 men.defeated at leipzig in 1813, he abdicated in 1814 and was exiled to elba.
in february 1815, napoleon escaped from elba for a ﬁnal 'hundred days' of power.he took over the government in paris on 20 march and prepared for war once more.his renewed attempt to dominate europe failed, however, and he ﬁnally surrendered to the british after the french defeat at waterloo on 18 june 1815.
this time he was exiled 5000 miles from europe, on the island of st helena, where he lived until his death on 5 may 1821.
Napoleon I, emperor of France is Also known as: Le Corse, Le Petit Caporal, Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleone Buonaparte, the Corsican, the Little Corporal
Napoleon I, also called Napoléon Bonaparte, was a French military general and statesman. Napoleon played a key role in the French Revolution (1789–99), served as first consul of France (1799–1804), and was the first emperor of France (1804–14/15). Today Napoleon is widely considered one of the greatest military generals in history.
Napoleon first seized political power in a coup d’état in 1799. The coup resulted in the replacement of the extant governing body—a five-member Directory—by a three-person Consulate. The first consul, Napoleon, had all the real power; the other two consuls were figureheads. Napoleon eventually abolished the Consulate and declared himself Emperor Napoleon I of France.
Napoleon served as first consul of France from 1799 to 1804. In that time, Napoleon reformed the French educational system, developed a civil code (the Napoleonic Code), and negotiated the Concordat of 1801. He also initiated the Napoleonic Wars (c. 1801–15), a series of wars that carried over into his reign as emperor of France (1804–14/15). As Emperor Napoleon I, he modernized the French military.
After a series of military defeats in 1812–13, Napoleon was forced to abdicate the French throne on April 6, 1814. Napoleon returned to power in early 1815 but was again ousted on June 22, 1815. In October 1815 Napoleon was exiled to the remote island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, where he remained until he died on May 5, 1821, at age 51.
“Le Petit Caporal” wasn’t petite—at least not by 19th-century standards. The estimated average height of a French man in 1820 was 5 feet 4 inches (about 1.65 meters). At the time of his death in 1821, Napoleon measured about 5 feet 7 inches (roughly 1.68 meters) tall, meaning that he was actually of above-average height.
Napoleon I (born August 15, 1769, Ajaccio, Corsica—died May 5, 1821, St. Helena Island) French general, first consul (1799–1804), and emperor of the French (1804–1814/15), one of the most celebrated personages in the history of the West. He revolutionized military organization and training; sponsored the Napoleonic Code, the prototype of later civil-law codes; reorganized education; and established the long-lived Concordat with the papacy.
Napoleon’s many reforms left a lasting mark on the institutions of France and of much of western Europe. But his driving passion was the military expansion of French dominion, and, though at his fall he left France little larger than it had been at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he was almost unanimously revered during his lifetime and until the end of the Second Empire under his nephew Napoleon III as one of history’s great heroes.
Napoleon was born on Corsica shortly after the island’s cession to France by the Genoese. He was the fourth, and second surviving, child of Carlo Buonaparte, a lawyer, and his wife, Letizia Ramolino. His father’s family, of ancient Tuscan nobility, had emigrated to Corsica in the 16th century.
Carlo Buonaparte had married the beautiful and strong-willed Letizia when she was only 14 years old; they eventually had eight children to bring up in very difficult times. The French occupation of their native country was resisted by a number of Corsicans led by Pasquale Paoli. Carlo Buonaparte joined Paoli’s party, but, when Paoli had to flee, Buonaparte came to terms with the French. Winning the protection of the governor of Corsica, he was appointed assessor for the judicial district of Ajaccio in 1771. In 1778 he obtained the admission of his two eldest sons, Joseph and Napoleon, to the Collège d’Autun.
A Corsican by birth, heredity, and childhood associations, Napoleon continued for some time after his arrival in Continental France to regard himself a foreigner; yet from age nine he was educated in France as other Frenchmen were. While the tendency to see in Napoleon a reincarnation of some 14th-century Italian condottiere is an overemphasis on one aspect of his character, he did, in fact, share neither the traditions nor the prejudices of his new country: remaining a Corsican in temperament, he was first and foremost, through both his education and his reading, a man of the 18th century.
Napoleon was educated at three schools: briefly at Autun, for five years at the military college of Brienne, and finally for one year at the military academy in Paris. It was during Napoleon’s year in Paris that his father died of a stomach cancer in February 1785, leaving his family in straitened circumstances. Napoleon, although not the eldest son, assumed the position of head of the family before he was 16. In September he graduated from the military academy, ranking 42nd in a class of 58.

He was made second lieutenant of artillery in the regiment of La Fère, a kind of training school for young artillery officers. Garrisoned at Valence, Napoleon continued his education, reading much, in particular works on strategy and tactics. He also wrote Lettres sur la Corse (“Letters on Corsica”), in which he reveals his feeling for his native island. He went back to Corsica in September 1786 and did not rejoin his regiment until June 1788. By that time the agitation that was to culminate in the French Revolution had already begun. A reader of Voltaire and of Rousseau, Napoleon believed that a political change was imperative, but, as a career officer, he seems not to have seen any need for radical social reforms.
When in 1789 the National Assembly, which had convened to establish a constitutional monarchy, allowed Paoli to return to Corsica, Napoleon asked for leave and in September joined Paoli’s group. But Paoli had no sympathy for the young man, whose father had deserted his cause and whom he considered to be a foreigner. Disappointed, Napoleon returned to France, and in April 1791 he was appointed first lieutenant to the 4th regiment of artillery, garrisoned at Valence. He at once joined the Jacobin Club, a debating society initially favouring a constitutional monarchy, and soon became its president, making speeches against nobles, monks, and bishops. In September 1791 he got leave to go back to Corsica again for three months. Elected lieutenant colonel in the national guard, he soon fell out with Paoli, its commander in chief. When he failed to return to France, he was listed as a deserter in January 1792. But in April France declared war against Austria, and his offense was forgiven.
Apparently through patronage, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of captain but did not rejoin his regiment. Instead he returned to Corsica in October 1792, where Paoli was exercising dictatorial powers and preparing to separate Corsica from France. Napoleon, however, joined the Corsican Jacobins, who opposed Paoli’s policy. When civil war broke out in Corsica in April 1793, Paoli had the Buonaparte family condemned to “perpetual execration and infamy,” whereupon they all fled to France.

Napoleon Bonaparte, as he may henceforth be called (though the family did not drop the spelling Buonaparte until after 1796), rejoined his regiment at Nice in June 1793. In his Le Souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire), written at this time, he argued vigorously for united action by all republicans rallied round the Jacobins, who were becoming progressively more radical, and the National Convention, the Revolutionary assembly that in the preceding fall had abolished the monarchy.

At the end of August 1793, the National Convention’s troops had taken Marseille but were halted before Toulon, where the royalists had called in British forces. With the commander of the National Convention’s artillery wounded, Bonaparte got the post through the commissioner to the army, Antoine Saliceti, who was a Corsican deputy and a friend of Napoleon’s family. Bonaparte was promoted to major in September and adjutant general in October. He received a bayonet wound on December 16, but on the next day the British troops, harassed by his artillery, evacuated Toulon. On December 22 Bonaparte, age 24, was promoted to brigadier general in recognition of his decisive part in the capture of the town.
Augustin de Robespierre, the commissioner to the army, wrote to his brother Maximilien, by then virtual head of the government and one of the leading figures of the Reign of Terror, praising the “transcendent merit” of the young republican officer. In February 1794 Bonaparte was appointed commandant of the artillery in the French Army of Italy. Robespierre fell from power in Paris on 9 Thermidor, year II (July 27, 1794). When the news reached Nice, Bonaparte, regarded as a protégé of Robespierre, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy and treason. He was freed in September but was not restored to his command.
The following March he refused an offer to command the artillery in the Army of the West, which was fighting the counterrevolution in the Vendée. The post seemed to hold no future for him, and he went to Paris to justify himself. Life was difficult on half pay, especially as he was carrying on an affair with Désirée Clary, daughter of a rich Marseille businessman and sister of Julie, the bride of his elder brother, Joseph. Despite his efforts in Paris, Napoleon was unable to obtain a satisfactory command, because he was feared for his intense ambition and for his relations with the Montagnards, the more radical members of the National Convention. He then considered offering his services to the sultan of Turkey.
of its dispersal, submitted the new constitution of the year III of the First Republic to a referendum, together with decrees according to which two-thirds of the members of the National Convention were to be reelected to the new legislative assemblies. The royalists, hoping that they would soon be able to restore the monarchy, instigated a revolt in Paris to prevent these measures from being put into effect. Paul Barras, who had been entrusted with dictatorial powers by the National Convention, was unwilling to rely on the commander of the troops of the interior; instead, knowing of Bonaparte’s services at Toulon, he appointed him second in command. Thus, it was Napoleon who shot down the columns of rebels marching against the National Convention (13 Vendémiaire year IV; October 5, 1795), thereby saving the National Convention and the republic.
Bonaparte became commander of the Army of the Interior and, consequently, was henceforth aware of every political development in France. He became the respected adviser on military matters to the new government, the Directory. Also at this time, he came to know an attractive Creole, Joséphine Tascher de La Pagerie, who was the widow of General Alexandre de Beauharnais (guillotined during the Reign of Terror), the mother of two children, and a woman of many love affairs.

From every point of view, a new life was opening for Bonaparte. Having proved his loyalty to the Directory, he was appointed commander in chief of the Army of Italy in March 1796. He had been trying to obtain that post for several weeks so that he could personally conduct part of the plan of campaign adopted by the Directory on his advice. He married Joséphine on March 9 and left for the army two days later.
Arriving at his headquarters in Nice, Bonaparte found that his army, which on paper consisted of 43,000 men, numbered scarcely 30,000 ill-fed, ill-paid, and ill-equipped men. On March 28, 1796, he made his first proclamation to his troops:He took the offensive on April 12 and successively defeated and separated the Austrian and the Sardinian armies and then marched on Turin. King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia asked for an armistice; and, at the peace treaty in Paris on May 15, Nice and Savoy, occupied by the French since 1792, were annexed to France. Bonaparte continued the war against the Austrians and occupied Milan but was held up at Mantua. While his army was besieging this great fortress, he signed armistices with the duke of Parma, with the duke of Modena, and finally with Pope Pius VI.
At the same time, he took an interest in the political organization of Italy. A plan for its “republicanization” by a group of Italian “patriots” led by Filippo Buonarroti had to be shelved when Buonarroti was arrested for complicity in François-Noël Babeuf’s conspiracy against the Directory. Thereafter, Bonaparte, without discarding the Italian patriots altogether, restricted their freedom of action. He set up a republican regime in Lombardy but kept a close watch on its leaders, and in October 1796 he created the Cisalpine Republic by merging Modena and Reggio nell’Emilia with the papal states of Bologna and Ferrara occupied by the French army. Then he sent an expedition to recover Corsica, which the British had evacuated.
Austrian armies advanced four times from the Alps to relieve Mantua but were defeated each time by Bonaparte. After the last Austrian defeat, at Rivoli in January 1797, Mantua capitulated. Next he marched on Vienna. He was about 60 miles (100 km) from that capital when the Austrians sued for an armistice. By the preliminaries of peace, Austria ceded the southern Netherlands to France and recognized the Lombard republic but received in exchange some territory belonging to the old Republic of Venice, which was partitioned between Austria, France, and Lombardy. Bonaparte then consolidated and reorganized the northern Italian republics and encouraged Jacobin—radical republican—propaganda in Venetia. Some Italian patriots hoped that these developments would soon lead to the formation of a single and indivisible “Italian Republic” modeled on the French.

Meanwhile, Bonaparte grew uneasy at the successes of the royalists in the French elections in the spring of 1797 and advised the Directory to oppose them, if necessary, by force. He sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris, along with several officers and men to back the coup d’état of 18 Fructidor, year V (September 4, 1797), which eliminated the royalists’ friends from the government and legislative councils and also enhanced Bonaparte’s prestige. Thus, Bonaparte could conclude the Treaty of Campo Formio with Austria as he thought best. The Directory was displeased, however, because the treaty ceded Venice to the Austrians and did not secure the left bank of the Rhine for France. On the other hand, it raised Bonaparte’s popularity to its peak, for he had gained victory for France after five years of war on the Continent.
Only the war at sea, against the British, continued. The directors, who wanted to launch an invasion of the British Isles, appointed Bonaparte to command the army assembled for this purpose along the English Channel. After a rapid inspection in February 1798, he announced that the operation could not be undertaken until France had command of the sea. Instead, he suggested that France strike at the sources of Great Britain’s wealth by occupying Egypt and threatening the route to India. This proposal, seconded by Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand, the foreign minister, was accepted by the directors, who were glad to get rid of their ambitious young general.
The expedition, thanks to some fortunate coincidences, was at first a great success: Malta, the great fortress of the Hospitallers, was occupied on June 10, 1798, Alexandria taken by storm on July 1, and all of the delta of the Nile rapidly overrun. On August 1, however, the French squadron at anchor in Abū Qīr Bay was completely destroyed by Admiral Horatio Nelson’s fleet in the Battle of the Nile, so that Napoleon found himself confined to the land that he had conquered. He proceeded to introduce Western political institutions, administration, and technical skills in Egypt; but Turkey, nominally suzerain over Egypt, declared war on France in September. To prevent a Turkish invasion of Egypt and also perhaps to attempt a return to France by way of Anatolia, Bonaparte marched into Syria in February 1799. His progress northward was halted at Acre, where the British withstood a siege, and in May Bonaparte began a disastrous retreat to Egypt.

The Battle of the Nile showed Europe that Bonaparte was not invincible, and Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and Turkey formed a new coalition against France. The French armies in Italy were defeated in the spring of 1799 and had to abandon the greater part of the peninsula. These defeats led to disturbances in France itself. The coup d’état of 30 Prairial, year VII (June 18, 1799), expelled the men of moderate views from the Directory and brought into it men who were considered Jacobins. Yet the situation remained confused, and one of the new directors, Emmanuel Sieyès, was convinced that only military dictatorship could prevent a restoration of the monarchy: “I am looking for a sabre,” he said. Bonaparte did not take long to make up his mind. He would leave his army and return to France—in order to save the republic, of course, but also to take advantage of the new circumstances and to seize power. The Directory had, in fact, ordered his return, but he had not received the order, so that it was actually in disregard of his instructions that he left Egypt with a few companions on August 22, 1799. Their two frigates surprisingly escaped interception by the British, and Bonaparte arrived in Paris on October 14.
By this time French victories in Switzerland and Holland had averted the danger of invasion, and the counterrevolutionary risings within France had more or less failed. A coup d’état could therefore no longer be justified by any need to save the republic. Sieyès, however, had not given up his project, and now he had his “sabre.” From the end of October he and Bonaparte were in league together planning the coup, and on 18–19 Brumaire, year VIII (November 9–10, 1799), it was carried out: the directors were forced to resign, the members of the legislative councils were dispersed, and a new government, the Consulate, was set up. The three consuls were Bonaparte and two of the directors who had resigned, Sieyès and Pierre-Roger Ducos. But it was Bonaparte who was henceforth the master of France.
Bonaparte, now 30 years old, was thin and short and wore his hair cut close—le petit tondu, the “little crop-head,” as he was called. Not much was known about his personality, but people had confidence in a man who had always been victorious (the Nile and Acre were forgotten) and who had managed to negotiate the brilliant Treaty of Campo Formio. He was expected to bring back peace, to end disorder, and to consolidate the political and social “conquests” of the Revolution. He was indeed exceptionally intelligent, prompt to make decisions, and indefatigably hardworking but also insatiably ambitious. He seemed to be the man of the Revolution because it was due to the Revolution that he had climbed at so early an age to the highest place in the state. He was not to forget it; but, more than a man of the Revolution, he was a man of the 18th century, the most enlightened of the enlightened despots, a true son of Voltaire. He did not believe in the sovereignty of the people, in the popular will, or in parliamentary debate. Yet he put his confidence more in reasoning than in reason and may be said to have preferred “men of talent”—mathematicians, jurists, and statesmen, for instance, however cynical or mercenary they might be—to “technicians” in the true sense of the word. He believed that an enlightened and firm will could do anything if it had the support of bayonets; he despised and feared the masses; and, as for public opinion, he considered that he could mold and direct it as he pleased. He has been called the most “civilian” of generals, but essentially he never ceased to be a soldier.
Bonaparte imposed a dictatorship on France, but its true character was at first disguised by the constitution of the year VIII (4 Nivôse, year VIII; December 25, 1799), drawn up by Sieyès. This constitution did not guarantee the “rights of man” or make any mention of “liberty, equality, and fraternity,” but it did reassure the partisans of the Revolution by proclaiming the irrevocability of the sale of national property and by upholding the legislation against the émigrés. It gave immense powers to the first consul, leaving only a nominal role to his two colleagues. The first consul—namely, Bonaparte—was to appoint ministers, generals, civil servants, magistrates, and the members of the Council of State and even was to have an overwhelming influence in the choice of members for the three legislative assemblies, though their members were theoretically to be chosen by universal suffrage. Submitted to a plebiscite, the constitution won by an overwhelming majority in February 1800.
The Consulate’s work of administrative reform, undertaken at Bonaparte’s instigation, was to be more lasting than the constitution and so more important for France. At the head of the government was the Council of State, created by the first consul and often effectively presided over by him; it was to play an important part both as the source of the new legislation and as an administrative tribunal. At the head of the administration of the départements were the prefects, who carried on the tradition of the intendants of the ancien régime, supervising the application of the laws and acting as the instruments of centralization. The judicial system was profoundly changed: whereas from the beginning of the Revolution judges had been elected, henceforth they were to be nominated by the government, their independence assured by their irremovability from office. The police organization was greatly strengthened. The financial administration was considerably improved: instead of the municipalities, special officials were entrusted with the collecting of direct taxes; the franc was stabilized; and the Banque de France, owned partly by shareholders and partly by the state, was created. Education was transformed into a major public service; secondary education was given a semimilitary organization, and the university faculties were reestablished. Primary education, however, was still neglected.
Bonaparte shared Voltaire’s belief that the people needed a religion. Personally, he was indifferent to religion: in Egypt he had said that he wanted to become a Muslim. Yet he considered that religious peace had to be restored to France. As early as 1796, when he was concluding the armistice in Italy with Pope Pius VI, he had tried to persuade the pope to retract his briefs against the French priests who had accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which in practice nationalized the church. Pius VII, who succeeded Pius VI in March 1800, was more accommodating than his predecessor, and, 10 months after negotiations were opened with him, the Concordat of 1801 was signed reconciling the church and the Revolution. The pope recognized the French republic and called for the resignation of all former bishops; new prelates were to be designated by the first consul and instituted by the pope; and the sale of the property of the clergy was officially recognized by Rome. The concordat, in fact, admitted freedom of worship and the lay character of the state.
The codification of the civil law, first undertaken in 1790, was at last completed under the Consulate. The code, promulgated on March 21, 1804, and later known as the Napoleonic Code, gave permanent form to the great gains of the Revolution: individual liberty, freedom of work, freedom of conscience, the lay character of the state, and equality before the law; but, at the same time, it protected landed property, gave greater liberty to employers, and showed little concern for employees. It maintained divorce but granted only limited legal rights to women.

The army received the most careful attention. The first consul retained in outline the system instituted by the Revolution: recruitment by forced conscription but with the possibility of replacement by substitutes; the mixing of the conscripts with old soldiers; and the eligibility of all for promotion to the highest ranks. Nevertheless, the creation of the Academy of Saint-Cyr to produce infantry officers made it easier for the sons of bourgeois families to pursue a military career. Moreover, the École Polytechnique, founded by the National Convention, was militarized in order to provide officers for the artillery and engineers. Yet Bonaparte was not concerned about introducing new technical inventions into his army. He put his trust in the “legs of his soldiers”: his basic strategic idea was a fast-moving army.
The first consul spent the winter and spring of 1799–1800 reorganizing the army and preparing for an attack on Austria alone, Russia having withdrawn from the anti-French coalition. With his usual quick assessment of the situation, he saw the strategic importance of the Swiss Confederation, from which he would be free to outflank the Austrian armies either in Germany or in Italy as he might see fit. His past successes made him choose Italy. Taking his army across the Great St. Bernard Pass before the snow melted, he appeared unexpectedly behind the Austrian army besieging Genoa. The Battle of Marengo in June gave the French command of the Po valley as far as the Adige, and in December another French army defeated the Austrians in Germany. Austria was forced to sign the Treaty of Lunéville of February 1801, whereby France’s right to the natural frontiers that Julius Caesar had given to Gaul—namely, the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees—was recognized.

Great Britain alone remained at war with France, but it soon tired of the struggle. Preliminaries of peace, concluded in London in October 1801, put an end to hostilities, and peace was signed at Amiens on March 27, 1802.

General peace was reestablished in Europe. The first consul’s prestige increased still more, and his friends—at his suggestion—proposed that a “token of national gratitude” should be offered to him. In May 1802 it was decided that the French people should vote in referendum on the following question: “Shall Napoleon Bonaparte be consul for life?” In August an overwhelming vote granted him the prolongation of his consulate as well as the right to designate his successor.


Bonaparte’s conception of international peace differed from that of the British, for whom the Treaty of Amiens represented an absolute limit beyond which they were under no circumstances prepared to go. The British even hoped to take back some of the concessions they had been forced to make. For Bonaparte, on the other hand, the Treaty of Amiens marked the starting point for a new French ascendancy. He was, first of all, intent on reserving half of Europe as a market for France without lowering customs duties—to the indignation of British merchants. To revive France’s expansion overseas, he also intended to recover Saint-Domingue (Haiti; governed from 1798 by the black leader Toussaint Louverture), to occupy Louisiana (ceded to France by Spain in 1800), perhaps to reconquer Egypt, and at any rate to extend French influence in the Mediterranean and in the Indian Ocean. In continental Europe he advanced beyond France’s natural frontiers, incorporating Piedmont into France, imposing a more centralized government on the Swiss Confederation, and in Germany compensating the princes dispossessed of territory on the Rhine under the Treaty of Lunéville with shares of the secularized ecclesiastical states.
Great Britain was alarmed by this expansion of France in peacetime and found it scarcely tolerable that one state should command the coastline of the Continent from Genoa to Antwerp. The immediate occasion of Franco-British rupture, however, was the problem of Malta. According to the Treaty of Amiens, the British, who had taken the island on the collapse of the French occupation, should have restored it to the Hospitallers; but the British, on the pretext that the French had not yet evacuated certain Neapolitan ports, refused to leave the island. Franco-British relations became strained, and in May 1803 the British declared war.
The peace settlement had brought about the life consulate; the return of war was to stimulate the formation of the empire. The British government, which would have been glad to see Bonaparte deposed or removed by assassination, renewed its subsidies to the French royalists, who resumed their agitation and plotting. When a British-financed assassination plot was uncovered in 1804, Bonaparte decided to react vigorously enough to deter his opponents from any more such attempts. The police believed that the real head of the conspiracy was the young duc d’Enghien, a scion of the royal house of Bourbon, who was residing in Germany, a few miles across the frontier. Accordingly, with the agreement of Talleyrand and the police chief Joseph Fouché, the duke was kidnapped on neutral soil and brought to Vincennes, where he was tried and shot (March 21). This action provoked a resurgence of opposition among the old aristocracy but enhanced the influence of Fouché.
In the hope of consolidating his own position, Fouché now suggested to Bonaparte that the best way to discourage conspiracy would be to transform the life consulate into a hereditary empire, which, because of the fact that there would be an heir, would remove all hope of changing the regime by assassination. Bonaparte readily accepted the suggestion, and on May 18, 1804, the empire was proclaimed.
Though there was little change in the organization of the government of France, Napoleon as emperor revived a number of institutions similar to those of the ancien régime. In the first place, he wanted to be consecrated by the pope himself, so that his coronation should be even more impressive than that of the kings of France. Pius VII agreed to come to Paris, and the ceremony, which seemed equally outrageous to royalists and to the old soldiers of the Revolution, took place in Notre-Dame on December 2, 1804. At the last moment, the emperor took the crown from the pope and set it on his own head himself.

The imperial regime also instituted its symbols and titles. Princely titles were brought back for the members of Napoleon’s family in 1804, and an imperial nobility was created in 1808. As opposition was still lively, Napoleon intensified his propaganda and imposed an increasingly strict censorship on the press. A dictatorial regime allowed him to carry on his wars for years without worrying about French public opinion. Having been president of the Italian Republic (as the Cisalpine Republic was renamed) since January 1802, Napoleon in March 1805 was proclaimed king of Italy and crowned in Milan in May.
From 1803 to 1805 Napoleon had only the British to fight; and again France could hope for victory only by landing an army in the British Isles, whereas the British could defeat Napoleon only by forming a Continental coalition against him. Napoleon began to prepare an invasion again, this time with greater conviction and on a larger scale. He gathered nearly 2,000 ships between Brest and Antwerp and concentrated his Grand Army in the camp at Boulogne (1803). Even so, the problem was the same as in 1798: to cross the Channel, the French had to have control of the sea.

Still far inferior to the British navy, the French fleet needed the help of the Spanish, and even then the two fleets together could not hope to defeat more than one of the British squadrons. Spain was induced to declare war on Great Britain in December 1804, and it was decided that French and Spanish squadrons massed in the Antilles should lure a British squadron into these waters and defeat it, thus making the balance roughly equal between the Franco-Spanish navy and the British. A battle in the entrance to the Channel could then be fought with some chance of success.
The plan failed. The French squadron from the Mediterranean, under Admiral Pierre de Villeneuve, found itself alone at the appointed meeting place in the Antilles. Pursued by Nelson and not daring to attack him, it turned back toward Europe and took refuge in Cádiz in July 1805; there the British blockaded it. Accused of cowardice by the angry Napoleon, Villeneuve resolved to run the blockade, with the support of a Spanish squadron; but on October 21, 1805, he was attacked by Nelson off Cape Trafalgar. Nelson was killed in the battle, but the Franco-Spanish fleet was totally destroyed. The British had won a decisive victory, which eliminated the danger of invasion and gave them freedom of movement at sea.
The British had also succeeded in organizing a new anti-French coalition consisting of Austria, Russia, Sweden, and Naples. On July 24, 1805, three months before Trafalgar, Napoleon had ordered the Grand Army from Boulogne to the Danube (thus ruling out an invasion of England even if the French had won at Trafalgar). In the week preceding Trafalgar, the Grand Army won an outstanding victory over the Austrians at Ulm, and on November 13 Napoleon entered Vienna. On December 2, 1805, in his greatest victory, he defeated the combined Austrian and Russian armies in the Battle of Austerlitz. By the Treaty of Pressburg, Austria renounced all influence in Italy and ceded Venetia and Dalmatia to Napoleon, as well as extensive territory in Germany to his protégés Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden. The French then proceeded to dethrone the Bourbons in the Kingdom of Naples, which was bestowed on Napoleon’s brother Joseph. In July 1806 the Confederation of the Rhine was founded—soon to embrace all of western Germany in a union under French protection.
In September 1806 Prussia entered the war against France, and on October 14 the Prussian armies were defeated at Jena and at Auerstädt. The Russians put up a better resistance at Eylau in February 1807 but were routed at Friedland in June. In Warsaw Napoleon fell in love with Countess Marie Walewska, a Polish patriot who hoped that Napoleon would resurrect her country. Napoleon had a son by her.
The Russian emperor Alexander I could have continued the struggle, but he was tired of the alliance with the British. He met Napoleon at Tilsit, in northern Prussia near the Russian frontier. There, on a raft anchored in the middle of the Nemen River, they signed treaties that created the Grand Duchy of Warsaw from the Polish provinces detached from Prussia and, in effect, divided control of Europe between the emperors, Napoleon taking the west and Alexander the east. Alexander even made a vague promise of a land attack against the British possessions in India.
As Napoleon could no longer think of invading England, he tried to induce capitulation by stifling the British economy. By closing all of Europe to British merchandise, he hoped to bring about a revolt of the British unemployed that could force the government to sue for peace. He forbade all trade with the British Isles, ordered the confiscation of all goods coming from English factories or from the British colonies, and condemned as fair prize not only every British ship but also every ship that had touched the coasts of England or its colonies.

For the blockade to succeed, it had to be enforced rigorously throughout Europe. But, from the beginning, England’s old ally Portugal showed itself reluctant to comply, for the blockade would mean its commercial ruin. Napoleon decided to break down Portuguese opposition by force. Charles IV of Spain let the French troops cross his kingdom, and they occupied Lisbon; but the prolonged presence of Napoleon’s soldiers in the north of Spain led to insurrection. When Charles IV abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand VII, Napoleon, seeing the opportunity to rid Europe of its last Bourbon rulers, summoned the Spanish royal family to Bayonne in April 1808 and obtained the abdication of both Charles and Ferdinand; they were interned in Talleyrand’s château. After the bloody suppression of an uprising in Madrid, insurrection spread across the whole country, for the Spaniards would not accept Joseph Bonaparte, king of Naples, as their new king.


The subsequent defeat of his forces in Spain and Portugal were sensational blows to Napoleon’s prestige. Soon the Iberian Peninsula, up in arms, became a bridgehead on the Continent for the British. Under the energetic Arthur Wellesley (later 1st duke of Wellington), in command from 1809, the Anglo-Spanish-Portuguese forces were to achieve decisive successes.

At the Congress of Erfurt (September–October 1808), a conference with Alexander I, Napoleon assembled a great concourse of princes to impress the Russian emperor in an attempt to extract promises of help. Whether impressed or not, Alexander would make no definite commitment. Alexander’s refusal, furthermore, was partly prompted by Talleyrand, who had become dismayed by Napoleon’s policies and was already negotiating with the Russian emperor behind his master’s back.

By early 1809, however, with most of the Grand Army thrown into Spain, Napoleon seemed on the point of overcoming the revolt. Then, in April, Austria launched an attack in Bavaria in the hope of rousing all of Germany against the French. Napoleon once again defeated the Habsburgs (July 6) and by the Treaty of Schönbrunn (October 14, 1809) obtained the Illyrian Provinces, thus rounding out the “Continental System.”
In 1810 Napoleon’s fortunes were at their zenith, despite some failures in Spain and Portugal. He considered himself Charlemagne’s heir. He repudiated Joséphine, who had not given him a child, so that he could marry Marie-Louise, daughter of the Austrian emperor Francis I. The birth of a son, the king of Rome, in March 1811 seemed to assure the future of his empire—now at its greatest extent, including not only the Illyrian Provinces but also Etruria (Tuscany), some of the Papal States, Holland, and the German states bordering the North Sea. The empire was surrounded by a ring of vassal states ruled over by the emperor’s relatives: the Kingdom of Westphalia (Jérôme Bonaparte); the Kingdom of Spain (Joseph Bonaparte); the Kingdom of Italy (with Eugène de Beauharnais, Joséphine’s son, as viceroy); the Kingdom of Naples (Joachim Murat, Napoleon’s brother-in-law); and the Principality of Lucca and Piombino (Félix Bacciochi, another brother-in-law). Other territories were closely bound to the empire by treaties: the Swiss Confederation (of which Napoleon was the mediator), the Confederation of the Rhine, and the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. Even Austria seemed bound to France by Napoleon’s marriage to Marie-Louise.


The political map of Europe, which had been so complicated before 1796, was now greatly simplified. Yet the frontiers did not coincide either with geographic features or with “nationalities.” Whatever he may later have said, Napoleon, while he was in power, was not interested in realizing either German or Italian unity. Yet, by reducing the number of states, by pushing the frontiers about, by amalgamating populations, and by propagating institutions like those that the Revolution and nationalism had created in France, he prepared the ground for German and Italian unification. National feeling in Europe, stirred by French ideas and by contact with Frenchmen, in turn gave rise to the first resistance against French domination. From 1809 onward, Spanish guerrillas, supported by British troops, were harassing the French, and the Spanish national Cortes (parliament), convened at Cádiz by the insurrectionaries, in 1812 promulgated a constitution inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution of 1789 and by British institutions.
Since the Congress of Erfurt, the Russian emperor had shown himself less and less inclined to deal with Napoleon as a trusted partner. In the spring of 1812, therefore, Napoleon massed his forces in Poland to intimidate Alexander. After some last attempts at agreement, in late June his Grand Army—about 600,000 men, including contingents extorted from Prussia and from Austria—began to cross the Nemen River. The Russians retreated, adopting a scorched-earth policy. Napoleon’s army did not reach the approaches to Moscow until the beginning of September. The Russian commander in chief, Mikhail I. Kutuzov, engaged it at Borodino on September 7. The fight was savage, bloody, and indecisive, but a week later Napoleon entered Moscow, which the Russians had abandoned. On that same day, a huge fire broke out, destroying the greater part of the town. Moreover, Alexander unexpectedly refused to treat with Napoleon. Withdrawal was necessary, and the premature onset of winter made it disastrous. After the difficult crossing of the Berezina River in November, fewer than 10,000 men fit for combat remained with Napoleon’s main force.
This catastrophe heartened all the peoples of Europe to defy Napoleon. In Germany the news unleashed an outbreak of anti-French demonstrations. The Prussian contingents deserted the Grand Army in December and turned against the French. The Austrians also withdrew their troops and adopted an increasingly hostile attitude, and in Italy the people began to turn their backs on Napoleon.

Even in France, signs of discontent with the regime were becoming more frequent. In Paris a malcontent general, Claude-François de Malet, nearly succeeded in carrying out a coup d’état after announcing on October 23, 1812, that Napoleon had died in Russia. This incident was a major factor in Napoleon’s decision to hasten back to France ahead of the Grand Army. Arriving in Paris on December 18, he proceeded to stiffen the dictatorship, to raise money by various expedients, and to levy new troops.

Thus, in 1813 the forces arrayed against France were no longer armies of mercenaries but were those of nations fighting for their freedom as the French had fought for theirs in 1792 and 1793; and the French themselves, for all their courage, had lost their former enthusiasm. The emperor’s ideal of conquest was no longer that of the nation.

In May 1813 Napoleon won some successes against the Russians and Prussians at the Battles of Lützen and Bautzen, but his decimated army needed reinforcements. The armed mediation of Austria induced Napoleon to agree to an armistice, during which a congress was held at Prague. There Austria proposed very favourable conditions: the French Empire was to return to its natural limits; the Grand Duchy of Warsaw and the Confederation of the Rhine were to be dissolved; and Prussia was to return to its frontiers of 1805. Napoleon made the mistake of hesitating too long. The congress closed on August 10 before his reply arrived, and Austria declared war.

The French were even worse off than in the spring. The allies were gaining new troops every day, as one German contingent after another left Napoleon to go over to the other side. The greatest debacle since Napoleon came to power was the Battle of Leipzig, or “Battle of the Nations” (October 16–19, 1813), in which the Grand Army was torn to shreds. That defeat degenerated fast into collapse. The French armies in Spain, forced to retreat, had been defeated in June, and by October the British were attacking their defenses north of the Pyrenees. In Italy the Austrians took the offensive, crossed the Adige River, and occupied Romagna. Murat, now openly a traitor to the emperor who had made him king of Naples, entered into negotiations with the Viennese court. The Dutch and the Belgians demonstrated against Napoleon.
In January 1814 France was being attacked on all its frontiers. The allies cleverly announced that they were fighting not against the French people but against Napoleon alone, since in November 1813 he had rejected the terms offered by the Austrian foreign minister Klemens, Fürst (prince) von Metternich, which would have preserved the natural frontiers of France. The extraordinary strategic feats achieved by the emperor during the first three months of 1814 with the army of young conscripts were not enough; he could neither defeat the allies, with their overwhelming numerical superiority, nor arouse the majority of the French people from their resentful torpor. The Legislative Assembly and the Senate, formerly so docile, were now asking for peace and for civil and political liberties.

By the Treaty of Chaumont of March 1814, Austria, Russia, Prussia, and Great Britain bound themselves together for 20 years, undertook not to negotiate separately, and promised to continue the struggle until Napoleon was overthrown. When the allied armies arrived before Paris on March 30, Napoleon had moved east to attack their rear guard. The Parisian authorities, no longer overawed by the emperor, lost no time in treating with the allies. As president of the provisional government, Talleyrand proclaimed the deposition of the emperor and, without consulting the French people, began to negotiate with Louis XVIII, the brother of the executed Louis XVI. Napoleon had only reached Fontainebleau when he heard that Paris had capitulated. Persuaded that further resistance was useless, he finally abdicated on April 6.

By the Treaty of Fontainebleau, the allies granted him the island of Elba as a sovereign principality, an annual income of two million francs to be provided by France, and a guard of 400 volunteers. Also he retained the title of emperor. After unsuccessfully trying to poison himself, Napoleon spoke his farewell to his “Old Guard,” and after a hazardous journey, during which he narrowly escaped assassination, he arrived at Elba on May 4.
“I want from now on to live like a justice of the peace,” Napoleon declared on his little island. But a man of such energy and imagination could hardly be expected to resign himself to defeat at age 45.
In France, moreover, the Bourbon Restoration was soon exposed to criticism. Though in 1814 the majority of the French people were tired of the emperor, they had expressed no wish for the return of the Bourbons. They were strongly attached to the essential achievements of the Revolution, and Louis XVIII had come back “in the baggage train of the foreigners” with the last surviving émigrés who had “learnt nothing and forgotten nothing” and whose influence seemed to threaten most of the Revolution’s achievements. The apathy of April 1814 quickly gave way to mistrust. Old hatreds were revived, resistance organized, and conspiracies formed.

From Elba Napoleon kept a close watch on the Continent. He knew that some of the diplomats at Vienna, where a congress was deciding the fate of Europe, considered Elba, between Corsica and Italy, too close to France and to Italy and wanted to banish him to a distant island in the Atlantic. Also he accused Austria of preventing Marie-Louise and his son from coming to join him (in fact, she had taken a lover and had no intention of going to live with her husband). In addition, the French government refused to pay Napoleon’s allowance, so that he was in danger of being reduced to penury.

All these considerations drove Napoleon to action. Decisive as ever, he returned to France like a thunderbolt. On March 1, 1815, he landed at Cannes with a detachment of his guard. As he crossed the Alps, the republican peasants rallied round him, and near Grenoble he won over the soldiers dispatched to arrest him. On March 20 he was in Paris.


Napoleon was brought back to power as the embodiment of the spirit of the Revolution rather than as the emperor who had fallen a year before. To rally the mass of Frenchmen to his cause, he should have allied himself with the Jacobins, but this he dared not do. Unable to escape from the bourgeoisie whose predominance he himself had assured and who feared above all else a revival of the radical experiments of 1793 and 1794, he could only set up a political regime scarcely distinguishable from that of Louis XVIII. Enthusiasm ebbed fast, and the Napoleonic adventure seemed a dead end.
To oppose the allied troops massing on the frontiers, Napoleon mustered an army with which he marched into Belgium and defeated the Prussians at Ligny on June 16, 1815. Two days later, at Waterloo, he met the British under Wellington, the victor of the Peninsular War. A savage battle followed. Napoleon was in sight of victory when the Prussians under Gebhard Blücher arrived to reinforce the British, and soon, despite the heroism of the Old Guard, Napoleon was defeated.

Back in Paris, the parliament forced Napoleon to abdicate; he did so, in favour of his son, on June 22, 1815. On July 3 he was at Rochefort, intending to take ship for the United States, but a British squadron prevented any French vessel from leaving the port. Napoleon then decided to appeal to the British government for protection. His request granted, he boarded the Bellerophon on July 15. The allies were agreed on one point: Napoleon was not to go back to Elba. Nor did they like the idea of his going off to America. It would have suited them if he had fallen a victim to the “White Terror” of the returned counterrevolutionaries or if Louis XVIII had had him summarily tried and executed. Great Britain had no choice but to send him to detention in a far-off island. The British government announced that the island of St. Helena in the southern Atlantic had been chosen for his residence; because of its remote position, Napoleon would enjoy much greater freedom than would be possible elsewhere. Napoleon protested eloquently: “I appeal to history!”
On October 15, 1815, Napoleon disembarked in St. Helena with those followers who were voluntarily accompanying him into exile: General Henri-Gratien Bertrand, grand marshal of the palace, and his wife; the comte Charles de Montholon, aide-de-camp, and his wife; General Gaspard Gourgaud; Emmanuel Las Cases, the former chamberlain; and several servants. After a short stay at the house of a wealthy English merchant, they moved to Longwood, originally built for the lieutenant governor.

Napoleon settled down to a life of routine. He got up late, breakfasting about 10:00 AM, but seldom went out. He was free to go anywhere on the island so long as he was accompanied by an English officer, but he soon refused to comply with this condition and so shut himself up in the grounds of Longwood. He wrote and talked much. At first Las Cases acted as his secretary, compiling what was later to be the Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène (first published in 1823). From 7:00 to 8:00 PM Napoleon had dinner, after which a part of the evening was spent in reading aloud—Napoleon liked to hear the classics. Then they played cards. About midnight Napoleon went to bed. Some of his time was devoted to learning English, and he eventually began reading English newspapers; but he also had a large number of French books sent from Europe, which he read attentively and annotated.

St. Helena had a healthful climate, and Napoleon’s food was good, carefully prepared, and plentiful. His inactivity undoubtedly contributed to the deterioration of his health. The man who for 20 years had played so great a role in the world and who had marched north, south, east, and west across Europe could hardly be expected to endure the monotony of existence on a little island, aggravated by the self-imposed life of a recluse. He had also more intimate reasons for unhappiness: Marie-Louise sent no word to him, and he may have learned of her liaison with the Austrian officer appointed to watch over her, Adam, Graf (count) von Neipperg (whom she eventually married in secret without waiting for Napoleon’s death). Nor did he have any news of his son, the former king of Rome, who was now living in Vienna with the title of duke of Reichstadt. Though the severity of Sir Hudson Lowe has been much exaggerated, it is certain that this “jailer,” who arrived as governor of St. Helena in April 1816, did nothing to make Napoleon’s life easier. Napoleon from the start disliked him as the former commander of the Corsican rangers, a band of volunteers composed largely of enemies of the Bonaparte family. Always anxious to carry out his instructions exactly, Lowe came into conflict with Las Cases. He saw Las Cases as Napoleon’s confidant and had him arrested and expelled. Thenceforward, relations between the governor and Napoleon were limited strictly to those stipulated by the regulations.


Napoleon showed the first signs of illness at the end of 1817; he seems to have had an ulcer or a cancer of the stomach. The Irish doctor Barry O’Meara, having asked in vain for a change in the conditions under which Napoleon lived, was dismissed; so also was his successor John Stokoe, who was likewise thought to be well-disposed toward Napoleon. The undistinguished Corsican doctor who took their place, Francesco Antommarchi, prescribed a treatment that could do nothing to cure his patient. It is uncertain, however, whether Napoleon’s disease was curable at all, even by 21st-century methods. There has been continuing controversy about the cause of his death, but the evidence used by some to support the theory that Napoleon was poisoned is not considered conclusive by many scholars.

From the beginning of 1821, the illness became rapidly worse. From March, Napoleon was confined to bed. In April he dictated his last will:
On May 5 he spoke a few coherent phrases: “My God…the French nation…my son…head of the army.” He died at 5:49 PM on that day, not yet 52 years old. His body was dressed in his favourite uniform, that of the Chasseurs de la Garde, covered by the gray overcoat that he had worn at Marengo. The funeral was conducted simply, but with due propriety, in the Rupert Valley, where Napoleon had sometimes walked, beside a stream in which two willows were reflected. The stone covering his tomb bore no name, only the words “Ci-Gît” (“Here Lies”).
Napoleon’s fall set loose a torrent of hostile books designed to sully his reputation. One of the least violent of these was the pamphlet De Buonaparte, des Bourbons, et de la nécessité de se rallier à nos princes légitimes, pour le bonheur de la France et celui de l’Europe (1814; On Buonaparte and the Bourbons, and the Necessity of Rallying Around Our Legitimate Princes, for the Safety of France and of Europe) by the vicomte de Chateaubriand, a well-known writer of royalist sympathies. But this anti-Napoleonic literature soon died down, while the task of defending Napoleon was taken up. Lord Byron had published his “Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte” as early as 1814; the German poet Heinrich Heine wrote his ballad “Die Grenadiere”; and in 1817 the French novelist Stendhal began his biography Vie de Napoléon (Life of Napoleon). At the same time, the emperor’s most faithful supporters were working toward his rehabilitation, talking about him, and distributing reminders of him, including engravings. They idealized his life (“What a novel my life is!” he himself had said) and began to create the Napoleonic legend.
As soon as the emperor was dead, the legend grew rapidly. Memoirs, notes, and narratives by those who had followed him into exile contributed substantially to it. In 1822 O’Meara, in London, had his Napoleon in Exile; or, A Voice from Saint Helena published; in 1823 the publication of the Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire de France sous Napoléon, écrits à Sainte-Hélène sous sa dictée (Memoirs of the History of France During the Reign of Napoleon, Dictated by the Emperor at St. Helena) by Montholon and Gourgaud, began; Las Cases, in his famous Mémorial, presented the emperor as a republican opposed to war who had fought only when Europe forced him to fight in defense of freedom; and in 1825 Antommarchi published his Derniers moments de Napoléon (The Last Days of Emperor Napoleon). Thereafter the number of works in Napoleon’s honour increased continually; among them were Victor Hugo’s “Ode à la Colonne” (“Ode to the Column”), the 28 volumes of the Victoires et conquêtes des Français (“Victories and Conquests of the French”), edited by Charles-Louis-Fleury Panckoucke, and Sir Walter Scott’s Life of Napoleon Buonaparte, Emperor of the French. Neither police action nor prosecutions could prevent books, pictures, and objects evoking the imperial saga from multiplying in France.
After the July Revolution of 1830, which created the “Bourgeois Monarchy” under Louis-Philippe, thousands of Tricolor flags appeared in windows, and the government had not only to tolerate the growth of the legend but even to promote it. In 1833 the statue of Napoleon was put back on the top of the column in the Place Vendôme in Paris, and in 1840 the king’s son François, prince de Joinville, was sent in a warship to fetch the emperor’s remains from St. Helena to the banks of the Seine in accordance with his last wishes. A magnificent funeral was held in Paris in December 1840, and Napoleon’s body was conveyed through the Arc de Triomphe in the Place de l’Étoile to entombment under the dome of the Invalides.
Napoleon’s nephew Louis-Napoléon exploited the legend in order to seize power in France. Though his attempts at Strasbourg in 1836 and at Boulogne in 1840 were failures, it was chiefly because of the growth of the legend that he won election to the presidency of the Second Republic with an overwhelming majority in 1848 and was able to carry out the coup d’état of December 1851 and make himself emperor in 1852.

The disastrous end of the Second Empire in 1870 damaged the Napoleonic legend and gave rise to a new anti-Napoleonic literature, best represented by Hippolyte Taine’s Origines de la France contemporaine (1876–94; The Origins of Contemporary France). World Wars I and II, however, together with the experience of the 20th-century dictatorships, made it possible to judge Napoleon more fairly. Any comparison with Stalin or Hitler, for instance, can only be to Napoleon’s advantage. He was tolerant; he released the Jews from the ghettos; and he showed respect for human life. Brought up on the rationalist Encyclopédie and on the writings of the philosophies of the Enlightenment, he remained above all a man of the 18th century, the last of the “enlightened despots.” One of the gravest accusations made against Napoleon is that he was the “Corsican ogre” who sacrificed millions of men to his ambition. Precise calculations show that the Napoleonic Wars of 1800–15 cost France itself about 500,000 casualties—i.e., about one-sixtieth of the population—with another 500,000 imprisoned or missing. The loss of these young men did not greatly affect the growth of the population, however.


The social structure of France changed little under the First Empire. It remained roughly what the Revolution had made it: a great mass of peasants comprising three-fourths of the population—about half of them working owners of their farms or sharecroppers and the other half with too little land for their own subsistence and hiring themselves out as labourers. Industry, stimulated by the war and the blockade of English goods, made remarkable progress in northern and eastern France, whence exports could be sent to central Europe; but it declined in the south and west because of the closing of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The great migrations from rural areas toward industry in the towns began only after 1815. The nobility would probably have declined more swiftly if Napoleon had not restored it, but it could never recover its former privileges.

Above all, Napoleon left durable institutions, the “granite masses” on which modern France has been built up: the administrative system of the prefects, the Napoleonic Code, the judicial system, the Banque de France and the country’s financial organization, the centralized university, and the military academies. Napoleon changed the history both of France and of the world.
