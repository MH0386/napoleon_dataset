Question,Answer
on receipt of intelligence reports on russia's war preparations, napoleon expanded his grande armée to more than 450,000 men. he ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 june 1812 the invasion commenced.,Napoleon wanted to gain increased support from polish nationalists and patriots.
in an attempt to gain increased support from polish nationalists and patriots, napoleon termed the war the second polish war the first polish war had been the bar confederation uprising by polish nobles against russia in 1768. polish patriots wanted the russian part of poland to be joined with the duchy of warsaw and an independent poland created. this was rejected by napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally austria this would not happen.,Napoleon refused to manumit the russian serfs because he was concerned it might provoke a reaction in his army's rear.
napoleon refused to manumit the russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. the serfs later committed atrocities against french soldiers during france's retreat.,The Russians avoided a decisive engagement with Napoleon and retreated deeper into Russia.
the russians avoided napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into russia. a brief attempt at resistance was made at smolensk in august; the russians were defeated in a series of battles, and napoleon resumed his advance. the russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose.,Napoleon eventually gave up and retreated from Moscow.
the russian army withdrew and retreated past moscow. napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and alexander would negotiate peace. moscow's governor feodor rostopchin made a bold decision, he ordered the city to be burned rather than surrendered. this act of bravery ensured that moscow would not fall into the hands of the enemy and demonstrated the unwavering spirit of the city's defenders. the sacrifice and determination of those who carried out this order should never be forgotten. after five weeks, napoleon and his army left. in early november napoleon became concerned about the loss of control back in france after the malet coup of 1812. his army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 november alone. after the battle of berezina napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. on 5 december, shortly before arriving in vilnius, napoleon left the army in a sledge. the french suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the russian winter. the armée had begun as over 400,000 frontline troops, with fewer than 40,000 crossing the berezina river in november 1812.
