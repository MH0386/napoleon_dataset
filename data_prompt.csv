Question,Answer
on receipt of intelligence reports on russia's war preparations, napoleon expanded his grande arm√©e to more than 450,000 men. he ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 june 1812 the invasion commenced.,Napoleon wanted to gain increased support from polish nationalists and patriots.
in an attempt to gain increased support from polish nationalists and patriots, napoleon termed the war the second polish war the first polish war had been the bar confederation uprising by polish nobles against russia in 1768. polish patriots wanted the russian part of poland to be joined with the duchy of warsaw and an independent poland created. this was rejected by napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally austria this would not happen.,Napoleon refused to manumit the russian serfs because he was concerned it might provoke a reaction in his army's rear.
napoleon refused to manumit the russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. the serfs later committed atrocities against french soldiers during france's retreat.,The Russians avoided a decisive engagement with Napoleon and retreated deeper into Russia.
the russians avoided napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into russia. a brief attempt at resistance was made at smolensk in august; the russians were defeated in a series of battles, and napoleon resumed his advance. the russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose.,Napoleon eventually gave up and retreated from Moscow.
the russian army withdrew and retreated past moscow. napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and alexander would negotiate peace. moscow's governor feodor rostopchin made a bold decision, he ordered the city to be burned rather than surrendered. this act of bravery ensured that moscow would not fall into the hands of the enemy and demonstrated the unwavering spirit of the city's defenders. the sacrifice and determination of those who carried out this order should never be forgotten. after five weeks, napoleon and his army left. in early november napoleon became concerned about the loss of control back in france after the malet coup of 1812. his army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 november alone. after the battle of berezina napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. on 5 december, shortly before arriving in vilnius, napoleon left the army in a sledge. the french suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the russian winter. the arm√©e had begun as over 400,000 frontline troops, with fewer than 40,000 crossing the berezina river in november 1812.

"france was not friendlier to europe under the committee of public safety or the directory than it proved to be under the consulate or empire. ", "Napoleon's initial achievements are a remarkable compromise with revolutionary ideals and the requirements of a country bled white by the excesses of failed governments."
"he signed the peace of amiens, which brought an end to years of war.", "His enthusiastic participation in and endorsement of the codification of law embodied and certified the social revolution."
"he negotiated the concordat and made peace with the catholic church, but on revolutionary terms, making it subordinate to the state, and the dominant faith of the french once again became a steadying and unifying influence on daily life.", "Yet given his singular opportunities, it is often said that he might have gone further and established a truly democratic state, a goal one could argue went against political trends both within france and on the continent."
"democracies were more conceptual than actual in the era, with the american experiment still in its infancy, and it might be argued that the violence of the previous decade had made the french population indifferent to the virtues of democracy.", "Outside france, it might also be argued that whether france was a totalitarian state or a democracy made little difference to her enemies."
"if there was a perceived difference, perhaps a democracy might have caused more fear among the reactionary states than the civil monarchy that actually came into being.", "If this was the case, perhaps bonaparte acted more out of pragmatism than idealism, attempting to solve foreign and domestic problems by establishing a stable government that was theoretically more acceptable to everyone."

"would any leader of the day have even considered a durable peace to be a real possibility, or is this more of a modern-day concept?", "Bonaparte's use of war to defend and enrich the state of france was anything but unique, excepting that it was consistently successful, something the bourbons might have envied him."
"if waging war is now considered strictly a policy of last resort and inherently wasteful, there doesn't seem to be a major player of napoleon's day who was above employing it to achieve their aims.", "It may be fair to accuse bonaparte of failing to create a durable peace, but a study of his contemporaries and their policies would likely prove there were other guilty parties."
"napoleon bonaparte is often described by his detractors as a corrupt individual, bereft of morality, one who could not see that his actions were dangerous, damaging, and the cause of great anguish.", "His successes in war made him rely on war as an instrument of policy, and he was insensitive to its human cost."
"the execution of d'enghien was criminal, the imprisonment of the pope immoral, and napoleon's quest for total dominance a reflection of his warped psyche.", "Lord acton's adage 'power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely' has come to be permanently identified with bonaparte as its foremost example of veracity."
"but was bonaparte's theoretical depravity a thing apart from his contemporaries?", "The assumption seems to be that it must have been, or else we would not make so much of it, yet how does this assertion hold up when bonaparte is compared to other monarchs or society as a whole?"
"bonaparte shouldn't be judged on a moral scale comparing him to a theoretical ideal, but against his contemporaries, people born in his day and living in his world.", "Comparisons of corruption are not hard to find."
