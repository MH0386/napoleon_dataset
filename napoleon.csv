"When in 1789 the national assembly, which had convened to establish a constitutional monarchy, allowed paoli to return to Corsica, napoleon asked for leave and in September joined paoli's group.",
"but paoli had no sympathy for the young man, whose father had deserted his cause and whom he considered to be a foreigner.",
"disappointed, napoleon returned to France, and in April 1791 he was appointed first lieutenant to the 4th regiment of artillery, garrisoned at valence.",
"he at once joined the Jacobin club, a debating society initially favouring a constitutional monarchy, and soon became its president, making speeches against nobles, monks, and bishops.",
"in September 1791 he got leave to go back to Corsica again for three months.",
"elected lieutenant colonel in the national guard, he soon fell out with paoli, its commander in chief.",
"When he failed to return to France, he was listed as a deserter in January 1792.",
"but in April France declared war against Austria, and his offense was forgiven.",
"apparently through patronage, napoleon was promoted to the rank of captain but did not rejoin his regiment.",
"instead he returned to Corsica in October 1792, where paoli was exercising dictatorial powers and preparing to separate Corsica from France.",
"napoleon, however, joined the Corsican Jacobins, who opposed paoli's policy.",
"When civil war broke out in Corsica in April 1793, paoli had the buonaparte family condemned to 'perpetual execration and infamy', whereupon they all fled to France.",
"napoleon Bonaparte, as he may henceforth be called (though the family did not drop the spelling buonaparte until after 1796), rejoined his regiment at nice in June 1793.",
"in his le souper de beaucaire (supper at beaucaire), written at this time, he argued vigorously for united action by all republicans rallied round the Jacobins, who were becoming progressively more radical, and the national convention, the revolutionary assembly that in the preceding fall had abolished the monarchy.",
"at the end of august 1793, the national convention's troops had taken marseille but were halted before Toulon, where the royalists had called in British forces.",
"with the commander of the national convention's artillery wounded, Bonaparte got the post through the commissioner to the army, antoine saliceti, who was a Corsican deputy and a friend of napoleon's family.",
"Bonaparte was promoted to major in September and adjutant general in October.",
"he received a bayonet wound on December 16, but on the next day the British troops, harassed by his artillery, evacuated Toulon.",
"on December 22 Bonaparte, age 24, was promoted to brigadier general in recognition of his decisive part in the capture of the town.",
"Augustin de Robespierre, the commissioner to the army, wrote to his brother Maximilien, by then virtual head of the government and one of the leading figures of the reign of terror, praising the 'transcendent merit' of the young republican officer.",
"in February 1794 Bonaparte was appointed commandant of the artillery in the french army of Italy.",
"Robespierre fell from power in Paris on 9 Thermidor, year ii (July 27, 1794).",
"When the news reached nice, Bonaparte, regarded as a protégé of Robespierre, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy and treason.",
"he was freed in September but was not restored to his command.",
"the following march he refused an offer to command the artillery in the army of the west, which was fighting the counterrevolution in the vendée.",
"the post seemed to hold no future for him, and he went to Paris to justify himself.",
"life was challenging on half pay, especially since he was having an affair with désirée clary, the daughter of a wealthy businessman from marseille and the sister of Julie, his elder brother joseph's bride.",
"despite his efforts in Paris, napoleon was unable to obtain a satisfactory command, because he was feared for his intense ambition and for his relations with the Montagnards, the more radical members of the national convention.",
"he then considered offering his services to the sultan of turkey.",
"of its dispersal, submitted the new constitution of the year III of the first republic to a referendum, together with decrees according to which two-thirds of the members of the national convention were to be reelected to the new legislative assemblies.",
"the royalists, hoping that they would soon be able to restore the monarchy, instigated a revolt in Paris to prevent these measures from being put into effect.",
"paul barras, who had been entrusted with dictatorial powers by the national convention, was unwilling to rely on the commander of the troops of the interior; instead, knowing of Bonaparte's services at Toulon, he appointed him second in command.",
"thus, it was napoleon who shot down the columns of rebels marching against the national convention (13 vendémiaire year iv; October 5, 1795), thereby saving the national convention and the republic.",
"Bonaparte became commander of the army of the interior and, consequently, was henceforth aware of every political development in France.",
"he became the respected adviser on military matters to the new government, the directory.",
"also at this time, he came to know an attractive creole, joséphine Tascher de la pagerie, who was the widow of general alexandre de beauharnais (guillotined during the reign of terror), the mother of two children, and a woman of many love affairs.",
"from every point of view, a new life was opening for Bonaparte.",
"having proved his loyalty to the directory, he was appointed commander in chief of the army of Italy in march 1796.",
"he had been trying to obtain that post for several weeks so that he Could personally conduct part of the plan of campaign adopted by the directory on his advice.",
"he married joséphine on march 9 and left for the army two days later.",
"arriving at his headquarters in nice, Bonaparte found that his army, which on paper consisted of 43,000 men, numbered scarcely 30,000 ill-fed, ill-paid, and ill-equipped men.",
"on march 28, 1796, he made his first proclamation to his troops:he took the offensive on April 12 and successively defeated and separated the Austrian and the Sardinian armies and then marched on turin.",
"king victor Amadeus III of Sardinia asked for an armistice; and, at the peace treaty in Paris on may 15, nice and savoy, occupied by the french since 1792, were annexed to France.",
"Bonaparte continued the war against the Austrians and occupied Milan but was held up at mantua.",
"while his army was besieging this great fortress, he signed armistices with the duke of parma, with the duke of modena, and finally with pope Pius vi.",
"at the same time, he took an interest in the political organization of Italy.",
"a plan for its 'republicanization' by a group of Italian 'patriots' led by filippo Buonarroti had to be shelved When Buonarroti was arrested for complicity in François-noël babeuf's conspiracy against the directory.",
"thereafter, Bonaparte, without discarding the Italian patriots altogether, restricted their freedom of action.",
"he set up a republican regime in lombardy but kept a close watch on its leaders, and in October 1796 he created the cisalpine republic by merging modena and reggio nell'emilia with the papal states of bologna and ferrara occupied by the french army.",
"then he sent an expedition to recover Corsica, which the British had evacuated.",
"Austrian armies advanced four times from the alps to relieve mantua but were defeated each time by Bonaparte.",
"after the last Austrian defeat, at Rivoli in January 1797, mantua capitulated.",
"next he marched on Vienna.",
"he was about 60 miles (100 km) from that capital When the Austrians sued for an armistice.",
"by the preliminaries of peace, Austria ceded the southern Netherlands to France and recognized the lombard republic but received in exchange some territory belonging to the old republic of Venice, which was partitioned between Austria, France, and lombardy.",
"Bonaparte then consolidated and reorganized the northern Italian republics and encouraged Jacobin radical republican propaganda in venetia.",
"some Italian patriots hoped that these developments would soon lead to the formation of a single and indivisible 'Italian republic' modeled on the french.",
"meanwhile, Bonaparte grew uneasy at the successes of the royalists in the french elections in the spring of 1797 and advised the directory to oppose them, if necessary, by force.",
"he sent general Pierre augereau to Paris, along with several officers and men to back the coup d'état of 18 fructidor, year v (September 4, 1797), which eliminated the royalists' friends from the government and legislative councils and also enhanced Bonaparte's prestige.",
"thus, Bonaparte Could conclude the treaty of campo formio with Austria as he thought best.",
"the directory was displeased, however, because the treaty ceded Venice to the Austrians and did not secure the left bank of the rhine for France.",
"on the other hand, it raised Bonaparte's popularity to its peak, for he had gained victory for France after five years of war on the continent.",
"only the war at sea, against the British, continued.",
"the directors, who wanted to launch an invasion of the British isles, appointed Bonaparte to command the army assembled for this purpose along the English channel.",
"after a rapid inspection in February 1798, he announced that the operation Could not be undertaken until France had command of the sea.",
"instead, he suggested that France strike at the sources of great britain's wealth by occupying Egypt and threatening the route to India.",
"this proposal was seconded by Charles-maurice de Talleyrand, the foreign minister, and accepted by the directors who were pleased to be rid of their ambitious young general.",
"the expedition, thanks to some fortunate coincidences, was at first a great success: malta, the great fortress of the hospitallers, was occupied on June 10, 1798, alexandria taken by storm on July 1, and all of the delta of the Nile rapidly overrun.",
"on august 1, however, the french squadron at anchor in abū qīr bay was completely destroyed by admiral horatio nelson's fleet in the battle of the Nile, so that napoleon found himself confined to the land that he had conquered.",
"he proceeded to introduce western political institutions, administration, and technical skills in Egypt; but turkey, nominally suzerain over Egypt, declared war on France in September.",
"to prevent a Turkish invasion of Egypt and also perhaps to attempt a return to France by way of anatolia, Bonaparte marched into Syria in February 1799.",
"his progress northward was halted at acre, where the British withstood a siege, and in may Bonaparte began a disastrous retreat to Egypt.",
"the battle of the Nile showed Europe that Bonaparte was not invincible, and great britain, Austria, Russia, and turkey formed a new coalition against France.",
"the french armies in Italy were defeated in the spring of 1799 and had to abandon the greater part of the peninsula.",
"these defeats led to disturbances in France itself.",
"the coup d'état of 30 Prairial, year vii (June 18, 1799), expelled the men of moderate views from the directory and brought into it men who were considered Jacobins.",
"yet the situation remained confused, and one of the new directors, Emmanuel Sieyès, was convinced that only military dictatorship Could prevent a restoration of the monarchy: 'I am looking for a sabre', he said.",
"Bonaparte did not take long to make up his mind.",
"he would leave his army and return to France in order to save the republic, of course, but also to take advantage of the new circumstances and to seize power.",
"the directory had, in fact, ordered his return, but he had not received the order, so that it was actually in disregard of his instructions that he left Egypt with a few companions on august 22, 1799.",
"their two frigates surprisingly escaped interception by the British, and Bonaparte arrived in Paris on October 14.",
"by this time french victories in Switzerland and holland had averted the danger of invasion, and the counterrevolutionary risings within France had more or less failed.",
"a coup d'état Could therefore no longer be justified by any need to save the republic.",
"Sieyès, however, had not given up his project, and now he had his 'sabre'.",
"from the end of October he and Bonaparte were in league together planning the coup, and on 18 19 Brumaire, year VIII (November 9 10, 1799), it was carried out: the directors were forced to resign, the members of the legislative councils were dispersed, and a new government, the consulate, was set up.",
"the three consuls were Bonaparte and two of the directors who had resigned, Sieyès and Pierre-roger ducos.",
"but it was Bonaparte who was henceforth the master of France.",
"Bonaparte, now 30 years old, was thin and short and wore his hair cut close le petit tondu, the 'little crop-head', as he was called.",
"not much was known about his personality, but people had confidence in a man who had always been victorious (the Nile and acre were forgotten) and who had managed to negotiate the brilliant treaty of campo formio.",
"he was expected to bring back peace, to end disorder, and to consolidate the political and social 'conquests' of the revolution.",
"he was indeed exceptionally intelligent, prompt to make decisions, and indefatigably hardworking but also insatiably ambitious.",
"he seemed to be the man of the revolution because it was due to the revolution that he had climbed at so early an age to the highest place in the state.",
"he was not to forget it; but, more than a man of the revolution, he was a man of the 18th century, the most enlightened of the enlightened despots, a true son of Voltaire.",
"he did not believe in the sovereignty of the people, in the popular will, or in parliamentary debate.",
"yet he put his confidence more in reasoning than in reason and may be said to have preferred 'men of talent' mathematicians, jurists, and statesmen, for instance, however cynical or mercenary they might be to 'technicians' in the true sense of the word.",
"he believed that an enlightened and firm will Could do anything if it had the support of bayonets; he despised and feared the masses; and, as for public opinion, he considered that he Could mold and direct it as he pleased.",
"he has been called the most 'civilian' of generals, but essentially he never ceased to be a soldier.",
"Bonaparte imposed a dictatorship on France, but its true character was at first disguised by the constitution of the year VIII (4 nivôse, year VIII; December 25, 1799), drawn up by Sieyès.",
"the constitution in question did not explicitly mention the 'rights of man' or the ideals of 'liberty, equality, and fraternity'.",
"however, it did provide some reassurance to supporters of the french revolution by declaring the permanence of the sale of national property and by upholding laws against those who had fled the country, known as émigrés.",
"it gave immense powers to the first consul, leaving only a nominal role to his two colleagues.",
"the first consul namely, Bonaparte was to appoint ministers, generals, civil servants, magistrates, and the members of the council of state and even was to have an overwhelming influence in the choice of members for the three legislative assemblies, though their members were theoretically to be chosen by universal suffrage.",
"submitted to a plebiscite, the constitution won by an overwhelming majority in February 1800.",
"the consulate's work of administrative reform, undertaken at Bonaparte's instigation, was to be more lasting than the constitution and so more important for France.",
"at the head of the government was the council of state, created by the first consul and often effectively presided over by him; it was to play an important part both as the source of the new legislation and as an administrative tribunal.",
"at the head of the administration of the départements were the prefects, who carried on the tradition of the intendants of the ancien régime, supervising the application of the laws and acting as the instruments of centralization.",
"the judicial system was profoundly changed: whereas from the beginning of the revolution judges had been elected, henceforth they were to be nominated by the government, their independence assured by their irremovability from office.",
"the police organization was greatly strengthened.",
"the financial administration was considerably improved: instead of the municipalities, special officials were entrusted with the collecting of direct taxes; the Franc was stabilized; and the Banque de France, owned partly by shareholders and partly by the state, was created.",
"education was transformed into a major public service; secondary education was given a semimilitary organization, and the university faculties were reestablished.",
"primary education, however, was still neglected.",
"Bonaparte shared Voltaire's belief that the people needed a religion.",
"in Egypt he had said that he wanted to become a muslim.",
"yet he considered that religious peace had to be restored to France.",
"as early as 1796, When he was concluding the armistice in Italy with pope Pius vi, he had tried to persuade the pope to retract his briefs against the french priests who had accepted the civil constitution of the clergy, which in practice nationalized the church.",
"Pius vii, who succeeded Pius vi in march 1800, was more accommodating than his predecessor, and, 10 months after negotiations were opened with him, the concordat of 1801 was signed reconciling the church and the revolution.",
"the pope recognized the french republic and called for the resignation of all former bishops; new prelates were to be designated by the first consul and instituted by the pope; and the sale of the property of the clergy was officially recognized by rome.",
"the concordat, in fact, admitted freedom of worship and the lay character of the state.",
"the codification of the civil law, first undertaken in 1790, was at last completed under the consulate.",
"the code, promulgated on march 21, 1804, and later known as the Napoleonic code, gave permanent form to the great gains of the revolution: individual liberty, freedom of work, freedom of conscience, the lay character of the state, and equality before the law; but, at the same time, it protected landed property, gave greater liberty to employers, and showed little concern for employees.",
"it maintained divorce but granted only limited legal rights to women.",
"the army received the most careful attention.",
"the first consul retained in outline the system instituted by the revolution: recruitment by forced conscription but with the possibility of replacement by substitutes; the mixing of the conscripts with old soldiers; and the eligibility of all for promotion to the highest ranks.",
"nevertheless, the creation of the academy of saint-cyr to produce infantry officers made it easier for the sons of bourgeois families to pursue a military career.",
"moreover, the école Polytechnique, founded by the national convention, was militarized in order to provide officers for the artillery and engineers.",
"yet Bonaparte was not concerned about introducing new technical inventions into his army.",
"he put his trust in the 'legs of his soldiers': his basic strategic idea was a fast-moving army.",
"the first consul spent the winter and spring of 1799 1800 reorganizing the army and preparing for an attack on Austria alone, Russia having withdrawn from the anti-french coalition.",
"with his usual quick assessment of the situation, he saw the strategic importance of the swiss confederation, from which he would be free to outflank the Austrian armies either in Germany or in Italy as he might see fit.",
"his past successes made him choose Italy.",
"taking his army across the great st bernard pass before the snow melted, he appeared unexpectedly behind the Austrian army besieging genoa.",
"the battle of Marengo in June gave the french command of the po valley as far as the adige, and in December another french army defeated the Austrians in Germany.",
"Austria was forced to sign the treaty of lunéville of February 1801, whereby France's right to the natural frontiers that julius caesar had given to gaul namely, the rhine, the alps, and the pyrenees was recognized.",
"great britain alone remained at war with France, but it soon tired of the struggle.",
"preliminaries of peace, concluded in London in October 1801, put an end to hostilities, and peace was signed at Amiens on march 27, 1802.",
"general peace was reestablished in Europe.",
"the first consul's prestige increased still more, and his friends at his suggestion proposed that a 'token of national gratitude' should be offered to him.",
"in may 1802 it was decided that the french people should vote in referendum on the following question: 'shall napoleon Bonaparte be consul for life?' in august an overwhelming vote granted him the prolongation of his consulate as well as the right to designate his successor.",
"Bonaparte's conception of international peace differed from that of the British, for whom the treaty of Amiens represented an absolute limit beyond which they were under no circumstances prepared to go.",
"the British even hoped to take back some of the concessions they had been forced to make.",
"for Bonaparte, on the other hand, the treaty of Amiens marked the starting point for a new french ascendancy.",
"he was, first of all, intent on reserving half of Europe as a market for France without lowering customs duties to the indignation of British merchants.",
"to revive France's expansion overseas, he also intended to recover saint-domingue (haiti; governed from 1798 by the black leader toussaint louverture), to occupy Louisiana (ceded to France by Spain in 1800), perhaps to reconquer Egypt, and at any rate to extend french influence in the mediterranean and in the indian ocean.",
"in continental Europe he advanced beyond France's natural frontiers, incorporating piedmont into France, imposing a more centralized government on the swiss confederation, and in Germany compensating the princes dispossessed of territory on the rhine under the treaty of lunéville with shares of the secularized ecclesiastical states.",
"great britain was alarmed by this expansion of France in peacetime and found it scarcely tolerable that one state should command the coastline of the continent from genoa to antwerp.",
"the immediate occasion of Franco-British rupture, however, was the problem of malta.",
"according to the treaty of Amiens, the British, who had taken the island on the collapse of the french occupation, should have restored it to the hospitallers; but the British, on the pretext that the french had not yet evacuated certain neapolitan ports, refused to leave the island.",
"Franco-British relations became strained, and in may 1803 the British declared war.",
"the peace settlement had brought about the life consulate; the return of war was to stimulate the formation of the empire.",
"the British government, which wanted to depose or assassinate Bonaparte, resumed its subsidies to french royalists, who continued plotting and agitating.",
"When a plot to assassinate Bonaparte, financed by the British, was uncovered in 1804, he responded with enough force to deter future attempts.",
"the police believed that the real head of the conspiracy was the young duc d'enghien, a scion of the royal house of bourbon, who was residing in Germany, a few miles across the frontier.",
"accordingly, with the agreement of Talleyrand and the police chief joseph fouché, the duke was kidnapped on neutral soil and brought to vincennes, where he was tried and shot (march 21).",
"this action provoked a resurgence of opposition among the old aristocracy but enhanced the influence of fouché.",
"in the hope of consolidating his own position, fouché now suggested to Bonaparte that the best way to discourage conspiracy would be to transform the life consulate into a hereditary empire, which, because of the fact that there would be an heir, would remove all hope of changing the regime by assassination.",
"Bonaparte readily accepted the suggestion, and on may 18, 1804, the empire was proclaimed.",
"though there was little change in the organization of the government of France, napoleon as emperor revived a number of institutions similar to those of the ancien régime.",
"in the first place, he wanted to be consecrated by the pope himself, so that his coronation should be even more impressive than that of the kings of France.",
"Pius vii agreed to come to Paris, and the ceremony, which seemed equally outrageous to royalists and to the old soldiers of the revolution, took place in notre-dame on December 2, 1804.",
"at the last moment, the emperor took the crown from the pope and set it on his own head himself.",
"the imperial regime also instituted its symbols and titles.",
"princely titles were brought back for the members of napoleon's family in 1804, and an imperial nobility was created in 1808.",
"as opposition was still lively, napoleon intensified his propaganda and imposed an increasingly strict censorship on the press.",
"a dictatorial regime allowed him to carry on his wars for years without worrying about french public opinion.",
"having been president of the Italian republic (as the cisalpine republic was renamed) since January 1802, napoleon in march 1805 was proclaimed king of Italy and crowned in Milan in may.",
"from 1803 to 1805 napoleon had only the British to fight; and again France Could hope for victory only by landing an army in the British isles, whereas the British Could defeat napoleon only by forming a continental coalition against him.",
"napoleon began to prepare an invasion again, this time with greater conviction and on a larger scale.",
"he gathered nearly 2,000 ships between brest and antwerp and concentrated his grand army in the camp at Boulogne (1803).",
"even so, the problem was the same as in 1798: to cross the channel, the french had to have control of the sea.",
"still far inferior to the British navy, the french fleet needed the help of the Spanish, and even then the two fleets together Could not hope to defeat more than one of the British squadrons.",
"Spain was induced to declare war on great britain in December 1804, and it was decided that french and Spanish squadrons massed in the Antilles should lure a British squadron into these waters and defeat it, thus making the balance roughly equal between the Franco-Spanish navy and the British.",
"a battle in the entrance to the channel Could then be fought with some chance of success.",
"the plan failed.",
"the french squadron from the mediterranean, under admiral Pierre de Villeneuve, found itself alone at the appointed meeting place in the Antilles.",
"pursued by nelson and not daring to attack him, it turned back toward Europe and took refuge in cádiz in July 1805; there the British blockaded it.",
"accused of cowardice by the angry napoleon, Villeneuve resolved to run the blockade, with the support of a Spanish squadron; but on October 21, 1805, he was attacked by nelson off cape Trafalgar.",
"nelson was killed in the battle, but the Franco-Spanish fleet was totally destroyed.",
"the British had won a decisive victory, which eliminated the danger of invasion and gave them freedom of movement at sea.",
"the British had also succeeded in organizing a new anti-french coalition consisting of Austria, Russia, Sweden, and Naples.",
"on July 24, 1805, three months before Trafalgar, napoleon had ordered the grand army from Boulogne to the Danube (thus ruling out an invasion of England even if the french had won at Trafalgar).",
"in the week preceding Trafalgar, the grand army won an outstanding victory over the Austrians at ulm, and on November 13 napoleon entered Vienna.",
"on December 2, 1805, in his greatest victory, he defeated the combined Austrian and Russian armies in the battle of Austerlitz.",
"by the treaty of Pressburg, Austria renounced all influence in Italy and ceded venetia and dalmatia to napoleon, as well as extensive territory in Germany to his protégés Bavaria, württemberg, and baden.",
"the french then proceeded to dethrone the bourbons in the kingdom of Naples, which was bestowed on napoleon's brother joseph.",
"in July 1806 the confederation of the rhine was founded soon to embrace all of western Germany in a union under french protection.",
"in September 1806 Prussia entered the war against France, and on October 14 the Prussian armies were defeated at Jena and at auerstädt.",
"the Russians put up a better resistance at Eylau in February 1807 but were routed at Friedland in June.",
"in warsaw napoleon fell in love with countess Marie Walewska, a polish patriot who hoped that napoleon would resurrect her country.",
"napoleon had a son by her.",
"the Russian emperor alexander I Could have continued the struggle, but he was tired of the alliance with the British.",
"he met napoleon at Tilsit, in northern Prussia near the Russian frontier.",
"there, on a raft anchored in the middle of the nemen river, they signed treaties that created the grand duchy of warsaw from the polish provinces detached from Prussia and, in effect, divided control of Europe between the emperors, napoleon taking the west and alexander the east.",
"alexander even made a vague promise of a land attack against the British possessions in India.",
"as napoleon Could no longer think of invading England, he tried to induce capitulation by stifling the British economy.",
"by closing all of Europe to British merchandise, he hoped to bring about a revolt of the British unemployed that Could force the government to sue for peace.",
"he forbade all trade with the British isles, ordered the confiscation of all goods coming from English factories or from the British colonies, and condemned as fair prize not only every British ship but also every ship that had touched the coasts of England or its colonies.",
"for the blockade to succeed, it had to be enforced rigorously throughout Europe.",
"but, from the beginning, England's old ally Portugal showed itself reluctant to comply, for the blockade would mean its commercial ruin.",
"napoleon decided to break down Portuguese opposition by force.",
"Charles iv of Spain let the french troops cross his kingdom, and they occupied Lisbon; but the prolonged presence of napoleon's soldiers in the north of Spain led to insurrection.",
"When Charles iv abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand vii, napoleon, seeing the opportunity to rid Europe of its last bourbon rulers, summoned the Spanish royal family to Bayonne in April 1808 and obtained the abdication of both Charles and Ferdinand; they were interned in Talleyrand's château.",
"after the bloody suppression of an uprising in Madrid, insurrection spread across the whole country, for the spaniards would not accept joseph Bonaparte, king of Naples, as their new king.",
"the subsequent defeat of his forces in Spain and Portugal were sensational blows to napoleon's prestige.",
"soon the Iberian peninsula, up in arms, became a bridgehead on the continent for the British.",
"under the energetic arthur wellesley (later 1st duke of wellington), in command from 1809, the Anglo-Spanish-Portuguese forces were to achieve decisive successes.",
"at the congress of Erfurt (September October 1808), a conference with alexander I, napoleon assembled a great concourse of princes to impress the Russian emperor in an attempt to extract promises of help.",
"whether impressed or not, alexander would make no definite commitment.",
"alexander's refusal, furthermore, was partly prompted by Talleyrand, who had become dismayed by napoleon's policies and was already negotiating with the Russian emperor behind his master's back.",
"by early 1809, however, with most of the grand army thrown into Spain, napoleon seemed on the point of overcoming the revolt.",
"in April, Austria attacked Bavaria hoping to unite Germany against France.",
"napoleon once again defeated the Habsburgs (July 6) and by the treaty of schönbrunn (October 14, 1809) obtained the illyrian provinces, thus rounding out the 'continental system'.",
"in 1810 napoleon's fortunes were at their zenith, despite some failures in Spain and Portugal.",
"he considered himself Charlemagne's heir.",
"he repudiated joséphine, who had not given him a child, so that he Could marry Marie-Louise, daughter of the Austrian emperor Francis I.",
"the birth of a son, the king of rome, in march 1811 seemed to assure the future of his empire now at its greatest extent, including not only the illyrian provinces but also etruria (tuscany), some of the papal states, holland, and the german states bordering the north sea.",
"the empire was surrounded by a ring of vassal states ruled over by the emperor's relatives: the kingdom of westphalia (jérôme Bonaparte); the kingdom of Spain (joseph Bonaparte); the kingdom of Italy (with eugène de beauharnais, joséphine's son, as viceroy); the kingdom of Naples (joachim murat, napoleon's brother-in-law); and the principality of lucca and piombino (félix bacciochi, another brother-in-law).",
"other territories were closely bound to the empire by treaties: the swiss confederation (of which napoleon was the mediator), the confederation of the rhine, and the grand duchy of warsaw.",
"even Austria seemed bound to France by napoleon's marriage to Marie-Louise.",
"the political map of Europe, which had been so complicated before 1796, was now greatly simplified.",
"yet the frontiers did not coincide either with geographic features or with 'nationalities'.",
"whatever he may later have said, napoleon, while he was in power, was not interested in realizing either german or Italian unity.",
"yet, by reducing the number of states, by pushing the frontiers about, by amalgamating populations, and by propagating institutions like those that the revolution and nationalism had created in France, he prepared the ground for german and Italian unification.",
"national feeling in Europe, stirred by french ideas and by contact with frenchmen, in turn gave rise to the first resistance against french domination.",
"from 1809 onward, Spanish guerrillas, supported by British troops, were harassing the french, and the Spanish national cortes (parliament), convened at cádiz by the insurrectionaries, in 1812 promulgated a constitution inspired by the ideas of the french revolution of 1789 and by British institutions.",
"since the congress of Erfurt, the Russian emperor had shown himself less and less inclined to deal with napoleon as a trusted partner.",
"in the spring of 1812, therefore, napoleon massed his forces in Poland to intimidate alexander.",
"after some last attempts at agreement, in late June his grand army about 600,000 men, including contingents extorted from Prussia and from Austria began to cross the nemen river.",
"the Russians retreated, adopting a scorched-earth policy.",
"napoleon's army did not reach the approaches to Moscow until the beginning of September.",
"the Russian commander in chief, mikhail I.",

"moreover, alexander unexpectedly refused to treat with napoleon.",
"withdrawal was necessary, and the premature onset of winter made it disastrous.",
"after the difficult crossing of the berezina river in November, fewer than 10,000 men fit for combat remained with napoleon's main force.",
"this catastrophe heartened all the peoples of Europe to defy napoleon.",
"in Germany the news unleashed an outbreak of anti-french demonstrations.",
"the Prussian contingents deserted the grand army in December and turned against the french.",
"the Austrians also withdrew their troops and adopted an increasingly hostile attitude, and in Italy the people began to turn their backs on napoleon.",
"even in France, signs of discontent with the regime were becoming more frequent.",
"in Paris a malcontent general, claude-François de malet, nearly succeeded in carrying out a coup d'état after announcing on October 23, 1812, that napoleon had died in Russia.",
"this incident was a major factor in napoleon's decision to hasten back to France ahead of the grand army.",
"arriving in Paris on December 18, he proceeded to stiffen the dictatorship, to raise money by various expedients, and to levy new troops.",
"thus, in 1813 the forces arrayed against France were no longer armies of mercenaries but were those of nations fighting for their freedom as the french had fought for theirs in 1792 and 1793; and the french themselves, for all their courage, had lost their former enthusiasm.",
"the emperor's ideal of conquest was no longer that of the nation.",
"in may 1813 napoleon won some successes against the Russians and Prussians at the battles of lützen and bautzen, but his decimated army needed reinforcements.",
"the armed mediation of Austria induced napoleon to agree to an armistice, during which a congress was held at prague.",
"there Austria proposed very favourable conditions: the french empire was to return to its natural limits; the grand duchy of warsaw and the confederation of the rhine were to be dissolved; and Prussia was to return to its frontiers of 1805.",
"napoleon made the mistake of hesitating too long.",
"the congress closed on august 10 before his reply arrived, and Austria declared war.",
"the situation for the french was even worse than it was during the spring.",
"the allies were gaining new troops every day, as one german contingent after another left napoleon to go over to the other side.",
"the greatest debacle since napoleon came to power was the battle of Leipzig, or 'battle of the nations' (October 16 19, 1813), in which the grand army was torn to shreds.",

"the dutch and the belgians demonstrated against napoleon.",
"in January 1814 France was being attacked on all its frontiers.",
"the allies cleverly announced that they were fighting not against the french people but against napoleon alone, since in November 1813 he had rejected the terms offered by the Austrian foreign minister klemens, fürst (prince) von metternich, which would have preserved the natural frontiers of France.",
"the extraordinary strategic feats achieved by the emperor during the first three months of 1814 with the army of young conscripts were not enough; he Could neither defeat the allies, with their overwhelming numerical superiority, nor arouse the majority of the french people from their resentful torpor.",
"the legislative assembly and the senate, formerly so docile, were now asking for peace and for civil and political liberties.",

"'I want from now on to live like a justice of the peace', napoleon declared on his little island.",
"but a man of such energy and imagination Could hardly be expected to resign himself to defeat at age 45.",
"in France, moreover, the bourbon restoration was soon exposed to criticism.",
"though in 1814 the majority of the french people were tired of the emperor, they had expressed no wish for the return of the bourbons.",
"they were strongly attached to the essential achievements of the revolution, and louis xVIII had come back 'in the baggage train of the foreigners' with the last surviving émigrés who had 'learnt nothing and forgotten nothing' and whose influence seemed to threaten most of the revolution's achievements.",
"the apathy of April 1814 quickly gave way to mistrust.",
"old hatreds were revived, resistance organized, and conspiracies formed.",
"from Elba napoleon kept a close watch on the continent.",
"he knew that some of the diplomats at Vienna, where a congress was deciding the fate of Europe, considered Elba, between Corsica and Italy, too close to France and to Italy and wanted to banish him to a distant island in the atlantic.",
"also he accused Austria of preventing Marie-Louise and his son from coming to join him (in fact, she had taken a lover and had no intention of going to live with her husband).",
"in addition, the french government refused to pay napoleon's allowance, so that he was in danger of being reduced to penury.",
"all these considerations drove napoleon to action.",
"decisive as ever, he returned to France like a thunderbolt.",
"on march 1, 1815, he landed at cannes with a detachment of his guard.",
"as he crossed the alps, the republican peasants rallied round him, and near grenoble he won over the soldiers dispatched to arrest him.",
"on march 20 he was in Paris.",
"napoleon was brought back to power as the embodiment of the spirit of the revolution rather than as the emperor who had fallen a year before.",
"to rally the mass of frenchmen to his cause, he should have allied himself with the Jacobins, but this he dared not do.",
"unable to escape from the bourgeoisie whose predominance he himself had assured and who feared above all else a revival of the radical experiments of 1793 and 1794, he Could only set up a political regime scarcely distinguishable from that of louis xVIII.",
"enthusiasm ebbed fast, and the Napoleonic adventure seemed a dead end.",
"to oppose the allied troops massing on the frontiers, napoleon mustered an army with which he marched into belgium and defeated the Prussians at ligny on June 16, 1815.",
"two days later, at waterloo, he met the British under wellington, the victor of the peninsular war.",

"on July 3 he was at rochefort, intending to take ship for the united states, but a British squadron prevented any french vessel from leaving the port.",
"napoleon then decided to appeal to the British government for protection.",
"his request granted, he boarded the bellerophon on July 15.",
"the allies were agreed on one point: napoleon was not to go back to Elba.",
"nor did they like the idea of his going off to america.",
"it would have suited them if he had fallen a victim to the 'white terror' of the returned counterrevolutionaries or if louis xVIII had had him summarily tried and executed.",
"great britain had no choice but to send him to detention in a far-off island.",
"the British government announced that the island of st Helena in the southern atlantic had been chosen for his residence; because of its remote position, napoleon would enjoy much greater freedom than would be possible elsewhere.",
"napoleon protested eloquently: 'I appeal to history!'.",
"on October 15, 1815, napoleon disembarked in st Helena with those followers who were voluntarily accompanying him into exile: general henri-gratien bertrand, grand marshal of the palace, and his wife; the comte Charles de montholon, aide-de-camp, and his wife; general gaspard gourgaud; Emmanuel las cases, the former chamberlain; and several servants.",
"after a short stay at the house of a wealthy English merchant, they moved to Longwood, originally built for the lieutenant governor.",
"napoleon settled down to a life of routine.",
"he got up late, breakfasting about 10:00 am, but seldom went out.",
"he was free to go anywhere on the island so long as he was accompanied by an English officer, but he soon refused to comply with this condition and so shut himself up in the grounds of Longwood.",
"he wrote and talked much.",
"at first las cases acted as his secretary, compiling what was later to be the mémorial de sainte-hélène (first published in 1823).",
"from 7:00 to 8:00 pm napoleon had dinner, after which a part of the evening was spent in reading aloud napoleon liked to hear the classics.",
"then they played cards.",
"about midnight napoleon went to bed.",
"some of his time was devoted to learning English, and he eventually began reading English newspapers; but he also had a large number of french books sent from Europe, which he read attentively and annotated.",
"st Helena had a healthful climate, and napoleon's food was good, carefully prepared, and plentiful.",
"his inactivity undoubtedly contributed to the deterioration of his health.",
"the man who for 20 years had played so great a role in the world and who had marched north, south, east, and west across Europe Could hardly be expected to endure the monotony of existence on a little island, aggravated by the self-imposed life of a recluse.",
"he had also more intimate reasons for unhappiness: Marie-Louise sent no word to him, and he may have learned of her liaison with the Austrian officer appointed to watch over her, adam, graf (count) von neipperg (whom she eventually married in secret without waiting for napoleon's death).",
"nor did he have any news of his son, the former king of rome, who was now living in Vienna with the title of duke of reichstadt.",
"though the severity of sir Hudson lowe has been much exaggerated, it is certain that this 'jailer', who arrived as governor of saint Helena in April 1816, did nothing to make napoleon's life easier.",
"napoleon from the start disliked him as the former commander of the Corsican rangers, a band of volunteers composed largely of enemies of the Bonaparte family.",
"always anxious to carry out his instructions exactly, lowe came into conflict with las cases.",
"he saw las cases as napoleon's confidant and had him arrested and expelled.",
"thenceforward, relations between the governor and napoleon were limited strictly to those stipulated by the regulations.",
"napoleon showed the first signs of illness at the end of 1817; he seems to have had an ulcer or a cancer of the stomach.",
"the irish doctor barry o'meara, having asked in vain for a change in the conditions under which napoleon lived, was dismissed; so also was his successor john stokoe, who was likewise thought to be well-disposed toward napoleon.",
"the undistinguished Corsican doctor who took their place, Francesco Antommarchi, prescribed a treatment that Could do nothing to cure his patient.",
"it is uncertain, however, whether napoleon's disease was curable at all, even by 21st-century methods.",
"there has been continuing controversy about the cause of his death, but the evidence used by some to support the theory that napoleon was poisoned is not considered conclusive by many scholars.",
"from the beginning of 1821, the illness became rapidly worse.",
"from march, napoleon was confined to bed.",
"in April he dictated his last will: on may 5 he spoke a few coherent phrases: 'my god…the french nation…my son…head of the army'.",
"he died at 5:49 pm on that day, not yet 52 years old.",
"his body was dressed in his favourite uniform, that of the chasseurs de la garde, covered by the gray overcoat that he had worn at Marengo.",
"the funeral was conducted simply, but with due propriety, in the rupert valley, where napoleon had sometimes walked, beside a stream in which two willows were reflected.",
"the stone covering his tomb bore no name, only the words 'ci-gît' ('here lies').",
"napoleon's fall set loose a torrent of hostile books designed to sully his reputation.",
"one of the least violent of these was the pamphlet de buonaparte, des bourbons, et de la nécessité de se rallier à nos princes légitimes, pour le bonheur de la France et celui de l'Europe (1814; on buonaparte and the bourbons, and the necessity of rallying around our legitimate princes, for the safety of France and of Europe) by the vicomte de chateaubriand, a well-known writer of royalist sympathies.",
"but this anti-Napoleonic literature soon died down, while the task of defending napoleon was taken up.",
"lord byron had published his 'ode to napoleon buonaparte' as early as 1814; the german poet heinrich heine wrote his ballad 'die grenadiere'; and in 1817 the french novelist stendhal began his biography vie de napoléon (life of napoleon).",
"at the same time, the emperor's most faithful supporters were working toward his rehabilitation, talking about him, and distributing reminders of him, including engravings.",
"they idealized his life ('what a novel my life is!' he himself had said) and began to create the Napoleonic legend.",
"as soon as the emperor was dead, the legend grew rapidly.",
"memoirs, notes, and narratives by those who had followed him into exile contributed substantially to it.",
"in 1822 o'meara, in London, had his napoleon in exile; or, a voice from saint Helena published; in 1823 the publication of the mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de France sous napoléon, écrits à sainte-hélène sous sa dictée (memoirs of the history of France during the reign of napoleon, dictated by the emperor at st Helena) by montholon and gourgaud, began; las cases, in his famous mémorial, presented the emperor as a republican opposed to war who had fought only When Europe forced him to fight in defense of freedom; and in 1825 Antommarchi published his derniers moments de napoléon (the last days of emperor napoleon).",
"thereafter the number of works in napoleon's honour increased continually; among them were victor hugo's 'ode à la colonne' ('ode to the column'), the 28 volumes of the victoires et conquêtes des Français ('victories and conquests of the french'), edited by Charles-louis-fleury panckoucke, and sir walter scott's life of napoleon buonaparte, emperor of the french.",
"neither police action nor prosecutions Could prevent books, pictures, and objects evoking the imperial saga from multiplying in France.",
"after the July revolution of 1830, which created the 'bourgeois monarchy' under louis-philippe, thousands of tricolor flags appeared in windows, and the government had not only to tolerate the growth of the legend but even to promote it.",
"in 1833 the statue of napoleon was put back on the top of the column in the place vendôme in Paris, and in 1840 the king's son François, prince de joinville, was sent in a warship to fetch the emperor's remains from saint Helena to the banks of the seine in accordance with his last wishes.",
"a magnificent funeral was held in Paris in December 1840, and napoleon's body was conveyed through the arc de triomphe in the place de l'étoile to entombment under the dome of the invalides.",
"napoleon's nephew louis-napoléon exploited the legend in order to seize power in France.",
"though his attempts at strasbourg in 1836 and at Boulogne in 1840 were failures, it was chiefly because of the growth of the legend that he won election to the presidency of the second republic with an overwhelming majority in 1848 and was able to carry out the coup d'état of December 1851 and make himself emperor in 1852.",
"the disastrous end of the second empire in 1870 damaged the Napoleonic legend and gave rise to a new anti-Napoleonic literature, best represented by hippolyte taine's origines de la France contemporaine (1876 94; the origins of contemporary France).",
"world wars I and ii, however, together with the experience of the 20th-century dictatorships, made it possible to judge napoleon more fairly.",
"any comparison with stalin or hitler, for instance, can only be to napoleon's advantage.",
"he was known for his tolerance, release of jews from ghettos, and respect for human life.",
"brought up on the rationalist encyclopédie and on the writings of the philosophies of the enlightenment, he remained above all a man of the 18th century, the last of the 'enlightened despots'.",
"one of the gravest accusations made against napoleon is that he was the 'Corsican ogre' who sacrificed millions of men to his ambition.",
"precise calculations show that the Napoleonic wars of 1800 15 cost France itself about 500,000 casualties, about one-sixtieth of the population with another 500,000 imprisoned or missing.",
"the loss of these young men did not greatly affect the growth of the population, however.",
"the social structure of France changed little under the first empire.",
"it remained roughly what the revolution had made it: a great mass of peasants comprising three-fourths of the population about half of them working owners of their farms or sharecroppers and the other half with too little land for their own subsistence and hiring themselves out as labourers.",
"industry, stimulated by the war and the blockade of English goods, made remarkable progress in northern and eastern France, whence exports Could be sent to central Europe; but it declined in the south and west because of the closing of the mediterranean and the atlantic.",
"the great migrations from rural areas toward industry in the towns began only after 1815.",
"the nobility would probably have declined more swiftly if napoleon had not restored it, but it Could never recover its former privileges.",
"above all, napoleon left durable institutions, the 'granite masses' on which modern France has been built up: the administrative system of the prefects, the Napoleonic code, the judicial system, the Banque de France and the country's financial organization, the centralized university, and the military academies.",
"napoleon changed the history both of France and of the world.",
"napoleon Bonaparte (born napoleone di buonaparte; 15 august 1769 5 may 1821), later known by his regnal name napoleon I, was a french emperor and military commander who rose to prominence during the french revolution and led successful campaigns during the revolutionary wars.",

"this is an examination of napoleon to determine how his actions and achievements measure up against the opinion of his detractors.",

"yet given his singular opportunities, it is often said that he might have gone further and established a truly democratic state, a goal one Could argue went against political trends both within France and on the continent.",
"democracies were more conceptual than actual in the era, with the american experiment still in its infancy, and it might be argued that the violence of the previous decade had made the french population indifferent to the virtues of democracy.",
"outside France, it might also be argued that whether France was a totalitarian state or a democracy made little difference to her enemies.",
"if there was a perceived difference, perhaps a democracy might have caused more fear among the reactionary states than the civil monarchy that actually came into being.",
"if this was the case, perhaps Bonaparte acted more out of pragmatism than idealism, attempting to solve foreign and domestic problems by establishing a stable government that was theoretically more acceptable to everyone.",
"he might have reasonably imagined that any man who Could achieve that successful transition deserved the reins of power.",
"Bonaparte is also frequently held responsible for the 'Napoleonic' wars and seen as a prime cause of them.",
"it is argued that he should have prevented those wars with better statecraft and convinced the rest of Europe that France's new and ideologically threatening government was not an enemy.",
"whenever that policy failed, he should have won wars he Could not avoid and negotiated generous treaties, making friends of former enemies, showing the world that diplomacy and not warfare was the proper tool of statesmen.",
"yet Could any one man, acting unilaterally, defy centuries of rivalry and aggression to end the state of recurrent war in Europe? hardly a decade seemed to pass without one conflict or another in the previous two centuries.",
"would any leader of the day have even considered a durable peace to be a real possibility, or is this more of a modern-day concept?",
"Bonaparte's use of war to defend and enrich the state of France was anything but unique, excepting that it was consistently successful, something the bourbons might have envied him.",
"if waging war is now considered strictly a policy of last resort and inherently wasteful, there doesn't seem to be a major player of napoleon's day who was above employing it to achieve their aims.",
"it may be fair to accuse Bonaparte of failing to create a durable peace, but a study of his contemporaries and their policies would likely prove there were other guilty parties.",
"napoleon Bonaparte is often described by his detractors as a corrupt individual, bereft of morality, one who Could not see that his actions were dangerous, damaging, and the cause of great anguish.",
"his successes in war made him rely on war as an instrument of policy, and he was insensitive to its human cost.",
"the execution of d'enghien was criminal, the imprisonment of the pope immoral, and napoleon's quest for total dominance a reflection of his warped psyche.",
"lord acton's adage 'power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely' has come to be permanently identified with Bonaparte as its foremost example of veracity.",
"but was Bonaparte's theoretical depravity a thing apart from his contemporaries? the assumption seems to be that it must have been, or else we would not make so much of it, yet how does this assertion hold up When Bonaparte is compared to other monarchs or society as a whole? Bonaparte shouldn't be judged on a moral scale comparing him to a theoretical ideal, but against his contemporaries, people born in his day and living in his world.",
"comparisons of corruption are not hard to find.",
"britain financed and facilitated an assassination attempt on the first consul.",
"tsar alexander was implicated in the murder of his father.",

"some of these incidents were natural enough in their day, although we now find them indefensible.",
"if Bonaparte was corrupt, he certainly had some notable company.",
"napoleon is often described as being ruled by a gigantic ego.",
"his lust for power, the coup d'etat Brumaire, his dismissal of democracy and the establishment of empire, are all seen as benchmarks of rampant ambition.",
"comparisons with contemporary leaders are regarded as irrelevant or even futile, presumably because Bonaparte is assumed to have been greater than they, and presented with unique opportunities, all squandered on a quest for personal aggrandizement.",
"but if Bonaparte was indeed unique, and expected to accomplish deeds other men Could only dream of, would he not need an ego as large as his ambitions? achieving democracy in France and peace for Europe is not a task for a modest man, so was napoleon's ambition simply a sin because it pursued goals we disapprove of, or that it pursued those goals using methods we disapprove of?",
"as the leader of a totalitarian state, napoleon made his own ambitions synonymous with those of France.",
"with few abridgements to power, he was able to act as he saw fit, and is judged accordingly.",
"yet almost all the European states reflected the egos of their monarchs, and few of them were intent on fostering democracy, limiting their borders, or improving civil rights.",
"rather, each used their position to satisfy their ambitions, expand their borders, and increase their control over the nobility and populace.",
"there was little respect for minor states like those in Italy or Poland and the borders were redrawn after each conflict.",
"Bonaparte, in this company, seems to be regarded as megalomaniacal largely because he did not inherit his position, but achieved it by aggressively pursuing the same agenda as those born to power and doing so more effectively.",
"it seems that absolutists may be forgiven their sins for being born to them, but parvenus are guilty for having freely chosen them.",
"of course, Bonaparte was anything but pure, anything but modest, anything but democratic, and anything but a peacemaker.",
"but in the end, who else that sat on a throne in Europe Could claim to be? should he be assailed for sins that were so sadly common? what is it about napoleon Bonaparte that makes him the object of such unique criticism? is it because he holds a special place in our imaginations, a place that we hope would be an example of our better selves? was his genius, good fortune, and opportunity enough to condemn him, not so much for what he did, but what he failed to do? in the end is our greatest disappointment in Bonaparte simply that he was merely human?",
"napoleon was indirectly responsible for spreading many of the ideals of the french revolution throughout Europe.",
"although he never openly espoused revolutionary tenets his empire and government was in many ways the living embodiment of those ideals.",
"the three main areas that he had a significant impact were individualism, secularism, and nationalism.",
"individualism: prior to the french revolution, class or social status was more important in french society and government than the individual.",
"merit and ability was subordinated to your family status and whether you were of the noble class.",
"the revolution did away with this and stated that all individuals were equal in the eyes of the government.",
"how one advanced was based on merit rather than who one's ancestors were.",
"napoleon enshrined this with a new aristocracy based on merit.",
"those who performed and contributed were rewarded.",
"the new princes, dukes, and barons were men who earned their titles, most often on the battlefield.",
"a review of his marshals would show that they came from all walks of life, including a barrel maker, a cabin boy, a former sergeant, and a minor noble.",
"in addition to this, he created he legion of honor to recognize those who deeds merited it.",
"secularism: the french revolution placed the state above the church, an extremely revolutionary concept.",
"the revolution even went as far to ban organized religion.",
"napoleon was willing to heal the rift between the catholic church and the government, but only if the church did not meddle in state affairs.",
"the church lost its right to run schools, and to have special taxes and privileges, however napoleon did re-open the churches and was tolerant of all religions.",
"he even invited the pope Pius vii to his coronation to crown him the new emperor of France.",
"napoleon's true feelings on his relationship with the church were demonstrated by his actions at the coronation.",
"When the pope went to place the crown on napoleon's head, napoleon took the crown out of the pope's hands and crowned himself.",
"thus showing that he believed that since he embodied the state, the pope had no legitimate right to crown him for in the new France the state was not subordinate to the church.",
"Jacobin nationalism: prior to the revolution, the state was symbolized by the monarch and the loyalty of the people was to ruler not to the state.",
"the revolution made the government the sovereign of the people.",
"it was to this government the people owed their loyalties.",
"'national interests transcend dynastic and all other interests.",
"citizens are put in national armies and national schools.",
"national flag and anthem supplant royal ensign and hymn'.",
"napoleon built his empire based on these concepts.",
"it was his soldiers who ousted the old dynasties throughout Europe and gave rise to both german and Italian nationalism that eventually unified the numerous minor kingdoms, states, and principalities into the respective nations of Germany and Italy.",
"napoleon failed to conquer Russia in 1812 for several reasons: faulty logistics, poor discipline, disease, and not the least, the weather.",
"napoleon's method of warfare was based on rapid concentration of his forces at a key place to destroy his enemy.",
"this boiled down to moving his men as fast as possible to the place they were needed the most.",
"to do this napoleon would advance his army along several avenues and converging them only When necessary.",
"the slowest part of any army at the time was the supply trains.",
"while a soldier Could march 15 - 20 miles a day, a supply wagon was generally limited to about 10 - 12 miles a day.",
"to avoid being slowed down by the trains, napoleon insisted that his troops live as much as possible off the land.",
"the success of napoleon time after time in central Europe against the Prussians and the Austrians proved that his method of warfare worked.",
"however for it to work, the terrain must co-operate.",
"there must be a good road network for his army to advance along several axes and an agricultural base capable of supporting the foraging soldiers.",
"in 1812, napoleon invaded Russia with about 600,000 men and over 50,000 horses.",
"his plan was to bring the war to a conclusion within twenty days by forcing the Russians to fight a major battle.",
"just in case his plans were off, he had his supply wagons carry 30 days of food.",
"reality was a bit different.",
"napoleon found, as the germans found in 1941, that Russia had a very poor road network.",
"thus he was forced to advance along a very narrow front.",
"even though he allowed for a larger supply train than usual, food was to be supplemented by whatever the soldiers Could forage along the way.",
"but this was a faulty plan.",
"in addition to poor roads, the agricultural base was extremely poor and Could not support the numbers of soldiers that would be living off the land.",
"since these 600,000 men were basically using the same roads, the first troops to pass by got the best food that Could easily be foraged.",
"the second troops to go by got less, etc.",
"if you were at the rear, of course there would be little available.",
"the Russians made the problem worse by adopting a scorched earth policy of destroying everything possible as they retreated before the french.",
"as time went by, soldiers began to straggle, due to having to forage further away from the roads for food and weakness from lack of food.",
"the situation was just as bad for the horses.",
"grazing along the road or in a meadow was not adequate to maintain a healthy horse.",
"their food had to be supplemented with fodder.",
"the further the army went into Russia, the less fodder was available.",
"even the grass began to be thinned out, for like food the first horses had the best grazing, and those bringing up the rear had it the worse.",
"by the end of the first month, over 10,000 horses had died!",
"soldiers weakened by poor diets and fatigue are susceptible to disease.",
"typhus was rampant among the troops due to infestations of lice.",
"additionally, the poor food, combined with bad water, and camping on sites where tens of thousands bivouacked before (and thus contaminated the water and area with feces) made intestinal ailments such as diarrhea and dysentery common.",
"by the time napoleon had reached Moscow, three months later, over 200,000 of his soldiers were dead or hospitalized due to disease and exhaustion.",
"poor discipline was another major problem.",
"troops had to forage to survive.",
"the deeper they went into Russia the further they had to go each day to find food.",
"commanders lost control of their troops as many soldiers' only concern became finding food and just disappeared.",
"these soldiers did not necessarily die, but form a uncontrollable mass bringing up the rear.",
"as months went by, units cease to exist, except in name only.",
"this became especially true during the retreat in the late fall.",
"much of the army was soon a mob, with little cohesion and no effectiveness.",
"this in itself would not be too great of a detriment, except for the impact on those units that were still intact.",
"there were several cases during the retreat where mobs of soldiers broke into the few warehouses that contained supplies and destroyed more than they ate and leaving little or nothing for those fighting in the rear guard.",
"the worse case of this was in smolensk.",
"at a major warehouse bureaucrats insisted that the soldiers must be with their units before they would be issued food.",
"the troops couldn't handle this stupidity and rioted, demolishing the warehouse and much of the food that was stored there.",
"in another case, at the crossing of the berezina, thousands of soldiers in these mobs panicked When they were attacked by the Russians.",
"in their desperate attempt to cross the bridge it broke, and at least 10,000 - 20,000 soldiers died or were captured.",
"the final factor was the weather.",
"first it was too hot making it a dry, dusty march to Moscow.",
"then When the retreat began, it was too cold at first.",
"this was a bone-chilling well below zero cold that few had experienced before.",
"first to die were the weak who, too exhausted to walk, laid down and died.",
"as the little food supplies they had ran out, the strong got weaker and they too began to die.",
"but then the weather changed.",
"there was a warm spell which thawed the frozen roads slowing down the march even more.",
"roads that were heavily rutted, but solid soon were quagmires of mud.",
"streams that were once frozen were quick moving and obstacles that had to be overcome.",
"rivers that Could have been crossed without bridges now needed bridges.",
"all of which took precious time and energy, something the army did not have.",
"then once again the weather took a turn for the worse this time far colder than before.",
"thousands died in their sleep overcome by exhaustion and exposure.",
"by the time the army crossed into Poland in early December, less than 100,000 exhausted, tattered soldiers remained of the 600,000 proud soldiers who crossed the nieman five months before.",
