From November 1936 to March 1937, when the front stabilized, it’s inhabitants were witnesses to one of the most important battles of a conflict that began with the uprising of most of the army against the republican Government the 18th of July of 1936, supported by different political forces, that would soon call themselves Nationals. The military uprising failed in Catalonia, Valencia and Madrid and the Cuartel de la Montaña barracks where the rebels had dug in was assaulted and taken by left wing and anarchist militias. In the northeast of Spain, Navarra, part of Andalusia and the North of Morocco, then a Spanish colony, the rebellion was successful. From those areas the insurgent army directed itself to the capital advancing quickly from two directions, from the north under the command of General Emilio Mola and from the southwest the troops of Brigadier General José Enrique Varela.SPANISH CIVIL WAR (2016-03-15) by Rober GarcíaAgencia EFESPAIN SPANISH CIVIL WAR NATIONAL ZONE (1936-07-21) by RODRIGUEZAgencia EFEA Captain of the revolted army, Emilio Vela, same as all other rebel military in Spanish cities, reads in Toledo the declaration that proclaims the state of war which initiates the rebellion against the legitimate republican government.SPAIN SPANISH CIVIL WAR (1936-07-19) by -Agencia EFE“I HAVE UNDER MY COMMAND FOUR COLUMNS THAT MARCH TOWARDS THE CAPITAL, NOT COUNTING THE FIFTH THAT IS INSIDE MADRID”This phrase, thought to be said by general Emilio Mola is where the expression “Fifth Column” was coined, referring to sympathizers of the Coup d’Etat that were hidden in Madrid during the civil war sabotaging and distributing propaganda.
