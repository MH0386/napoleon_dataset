Why aren't territories counted like the states?Section 128 of the constitution sets out the rules for referendums, saying a majority of states must endorse change for a referendum to pass.The votes of people in territories still count towards the national majority, however the territory-wide results in the NT and ACT are not factored into the double majority.What are ABC projections?Once there are sufficient results reported in each state and territory to be certain of a result, the ABC will make a projection of a Yes or No outcome.This is done for each state and territory and also for the national result.How was the vote counted?Every ballot paper was counted by hand by AEC staff and volunteers, overseen by scrutineers. Counts at each polling place were also done twice to double-check results.The AEC said every ballot cast on referendum day would be counted on referendum night, along with the vast majority of prepoll votes.As polling places return their results, they are fed into the AEC's system, which then provides data to the ABC.Map of Voice referendum results by electorateSkip to electorate search See how Australia’s 151 federal electorates voted in the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum.The map is not intended to be geographically accurate.ACTACTNSWNSWNTNTQLDQLDSASATASTASVICVICWAWAElectorate VoteNoYesShow electorate namesGo deeper into the electorate mapScratch the surface of the Voice results, and a more complicated picture emergesStory Lab / By Tim Leslie, Ashley Kyd, Julian Fell, Ben Spraggon and Matt Liddy Scratch the surface of the Voice referendum results, and a more complicated picture emerges.Updated 15 Oct 202315 October 2023Sun 15 Oct 2023 at 7:56amElectorate ListSearch electorate.
