It is true, that    improvements have been made in the science of    medicine; but it requires a discriminating mind, and an extensive    knowledge of ancient as well as modern authors, so    to apply these improvements, as to be able to meet diseases, in all the    varying shapes, which they assume in the    routine of years.       Few    physicians in active practice in 1917 were practising at the time of    the pandemic of    1889-92. Perhaps fewer still were familiar with the history of acute    epidemic respiratory diseases    and the admirable clinical and pathological descriptions which were    recorded in medical    literature in the nineteenth century. It is thus not surprising that    the high morbidity, and more    especially the high mortality, of acute respiratory diseases which    occured during the World War    caused doubts to arise as to the identity of the diseases, and led to    differences in opinion as to the    proper nomenclature of the pathologic processes. Nevertheless, though    the morbidity possibly    was higher in 1918 than has been reported for any previous pandemic of    this disease, the    influence of increase in world population and the greater facility of    transportation must be    considered.       In    the pandemic of 1918 it appeared that, for the first time, the medical    profession was    prepared to settle the bacteriology of influenza. That it did not do so    was to some extent caused    by the fact that the entire profession was engaged in the care of the    sick. Some groups of medical    men were able to investigate the bacteriology of the cases in an    intensive manner, but an    insufficient number were able to do so; furthermore, there was no    opportunity to develop a    standard technique for such investigations. While it is probable that    the etiologic agent    responsible for influenza has been reported and described, there is not    sufficient evidence in the    form of agreement among workers or verification of bacteriological    results to determine that    agent beyond doubt. Furthermore, no explanation of the varied    bacteriological results that    satisfies even the majority of the medical profession has been made.       The    influenza bacillus of Pfeiffer still has the greatest claim for    consideration as the    etiologic agent of epidemic and pandemic influenza. In its favor are    its increased prevalence just    preceding and in the early part of the influenza epidemics and    pandemic; its decrease in    prevalence during the latter portion and after the pandemic;2    its presence in culture in the early    mild and also fulminant cases; the finding of organisms morphologically    and tinctorially    identical in tissues from which influenza bacilli were not recovered by    cultural methods and the    fact that it produces a true toxin, thus accounting for generalized    symptoms in the probable    absence of general dissemination of the bacteria throughout the body.    2     Against    the etiologic relationship of this organism to influenza is the failure    to find a    common strain as shown by serological and immunological reactions,    though this is discounted    by the fact that there are numerous hemophilic bacteria of similar    cultural and staining    characteristics frequently found in other conditions, the organism thus    apparently being a    member of a large group, to be compared with Group IV pneumococci. The    failure of many    bacteriologists to find the organism in appreciable numbers of cases is    in part explained by the    demonstration that streptococci and pneumococci growing in the same    culture inhibit the growth    of the influenza bacillus, also that fresh or unchanged blood inhibits    the growth, while blood    heated, as in the so-called chocolate plates, favors it. The    infrequence of influenza bacilli in    blood cultures can be explained at least partly by this inhibitory    influence of unchanged blood    and also by the fact that in histologic sections the organism is rarely    found except on the surface    of tissues, apparently having little power to penetrate them. It    extends rapidly along air passages,    however, producing lesions on the surface and there can generate easily    the toxic products which    give rise to the general symptoms. A review of published reports of    bacteriological    investigations does not justify us in saying, on the evidence    presented, that the organism was not    present even though the cultures were negative.       The    fact that suspensions of killed bacteria apparently show no protective    influence    presents no argument, pro or con, since the method of preparation may    have been of such    character as to destroy their immunity-producing action; moreover, we    are familiar with many    organisms, killed suspensions of which do not protect against    infection. Failure to produce the    disease by inoculation is not a very strong point against the    etiological significance of the    organism, for, with the widespread dissemination of the disease and the    occurrence of mild    cases, the presence of immunity or lack of susceptibility can not be    ruled out. Certain    experiments, particularly those of Cecil and Steffan,3    indicate that, given a virulent strain with    which to inoculate, characteristic symptoms can be produced in    susceptible persons. The    difficulty of determining the pathogenicity of the organism used and    the possibility of bacterial    variation must be considered in this connection.       No    other organism, isolated from the pandemic, appears to deserve much    consideration    as an etiologic factor of influenza. Bacterium pneumosintes 4    was isolated from cases after the    peak of the pandemic had passed and its status can not be determined    until the occurrence of    another similar outbreak of the disease.       While    it is not appropriate here to discuss the history of acute respiratory    disease, certain    lessons are taught by the experience of the armies of the United States    in previous wars which    should be reviewed in connection with the consideration of such    diseases during the World War.         3      WAR OF 1812 1      During    the winter of 1812-13, there was a high incidence of acute respiratory    disease    among the troops stationed on the northern frontier. Measles was    epidemic among the troops    from September to December, 1812. As the epidemic continued the    symptoms increased in    severity and pneumonic complications became more frequent. Beginning in    October, 1812, acute    respiratory disease independent of measles assumed epidemic proportions    and replaced the    diarrheas, dysenteries and "intermittents" (malaria) of the summer. It    was noted that the    morbidity and mortality was greater among troops from south of the    Delaware River. Morbidity    and mortality were less in the next winter for the Army as a whole, as    it consisted for the most    part of seasoned troops, yet it was noted that troops joining at that    time were as severely affected    as were the men mobilized the preceding year.      The    clinical features and the pathological anatomy of the cases were    identical with those    of the epidemics of the fall of 1917 and the spring of 1918; the    pathology of which, as is now    realized, is not to be differentiated from that of the influenza    pandemic of the fall of 1918.        This    influenzal disease attacked the troops of 1812 throughout the various    Army stations    but showed varied clinical pictures in different stations. A catarrhal    affection was universal    among the men at all stations at the time of the epidemic.        In    many of the early cases death occurred within one to four days of the    onset of severe    symptoms and appeared to be from suffocation rather than from that    group of symptoms usually    associated with pneumonia. The labored respirations were not from pain    but from a sense of    suffocation. Mann considered that the lung, by reason of engorgement of    the bronchi, excluded    air from the smaller ramifications and thus was "incapable of absorbing    or transmitting through    its membrane the vital principle of the atmospheric air." The lungs    were filled with blood, were    dense and heavy and frequently sank in water. Empyema was apparently    frequent in cases    surviving sufficiently long. The clinical picture varied as did the    pathology not only as between    stations but also at the same station. Repeated removal of small    amounts of blood was found an    efficacious method of treatment. The explanation of the efficacy of    bleeding is somewhat    obscure but it is noteworthy that during the last pandemic the blood    was found to be    concentrated and the removal of small amounts of blood and forcing    fluids appeared to be an    efficacious treatment in the early stages of the disease.5      Acute    respiratory diseases were not as prevalent in the winter season of    1813-14 but in    the fall of 1815-16, epidemic influenza spread over the eastern United    States and Brazil.6  4      Mann    described the clinical course and pathology of this epidemic in the    civil population    of Sharon, Mass., in considerable detail and stated that they were    identical with that seen in the    troops of the northern frontier during the two preceding seasons.a       CIVIL WAR    (1861-1865)        Acute    respiratory diseases were an important cause of morbidity and mortality    throughout the entire period of the Civil War. 7       There    was no such epidemic as the one of the fall of 1918 in the World War,    but there    were excessive seasonal variations in the respiratory disease rates    with a curve for "catarrh" in    the winter of 1862, resembling that for the influenza epidemic of 1918.    The percentage of fatal    cases of pneumonia for the five years 1861 to 1866, inclusive, was    24.08 for white troops, and    during the last three years it was 32.44 for colored troops. The rates    were higher during the first    year, decreasing rather slowly in the white troops and more rapidly in    the colored. In the    Confederate troops the acute diseases of the respiratory tract are    represented as being of more    serious import than among the Federal troops. In one hospital 37.18    percent of the cases of    pneumonia and pleurisy proved fatal. A comparison table shows an annual    death rate per    thousand for pneumonia of the Confederate armies as 20.6 and of the    Union troops 7.8. The    influence of measles in epidemic form was recognized as a predisposing    factor to a marked    increase in the bronchitis and pneumonia rate accompanied by an    increase in mortality.      The    diseases recorded were catarrh, epidemic catarrh, acute and chronic    bronchitis,    pneumonia, and acute diseases of the upper respiratory tract. After    1862, catarrh disappears from    the record, practically the entire rate of which in subsequent reports    appears to have been    included in that for acute bronchitis. Many cases of "epidemic catarrh"    were reported but there    was no spread of this condition as a general epidemic. The increased    incidencies were local in    character and occurred independently in different camps throughout the    course of the war. New    levies and organizations new to field service appeared to be most    liable to this condition.      Acute    bronchitis had a low death rate. Many of the deaths, however, followed    attacks of    measles. The pathological findings reported in the fatal cases were in    part those of intense    bronchitis, while a few showed the pathological             a  At Sharon,    the peripneumonia      notha made its first attack, with symptoms of uncomnmon coldness    and torpor,    which pervaded the whole system, without those strong rigors observed    in pleurisy, and intermittent fever; the heat    of the body at the same time, to the touch, much below the standard of    health. * * * There was a remarkable pale    pink coloured suffusion over the whole face, distinct from the usual    febrile blush in the cheeks; the appearance was    similar to the sudden flush colour, produced by sitting before a fire,    after having been exposed to cold. This    appearance was most conspicuous on persons having fair and light    complexions. This was accompanied with a    bloated countenance, which gave to the spare and pale-faced patient,    additional beauty to the general features. This    rouge-like appearance, was less conspicuous on the body, than the face.    It is to be noticed, that during the cold stage,    the patients suffered from pain throughout the muscles of the body, in    one case similar to rheumatism. In four or five    instances, this epidemic made its assault upon the head; which bleeding    immediately relieved; upon enquiry, I found    there was here no complaint whatever within the chest. It was then    prognosticated, that in 24 hours, more or less    disease would exhibit itself on the lungs. This prediction, which was    presumed upon former experience, on the    northern frontiers, was fulfilled in every instance where made; while    the pneumonic symptoms which followed, were    not eventually less severe, than in those cases, where the first    symptoms of disease showed themselves, within the    breast. The appearances were engorgements, congestions, and inflammations, even where there was previous    to    death no increase of heat. The bronchiae were charged with a mixture of    blood, and mucus. Where the disease had    been of some duration, adhesions of the lungs to the circumjacent parts    were noticed. The spongy mixture of this    viscus was lost; while it assumed in some measure, the solid and    compact state of the liver. It was sometimes    covered with a yellowish, glutinous, extravasated fluid, which adhered    with some force to its surface.    5      lesions of a hemorrhagic    pneumonitis without definite foci of consolidation, a pathology with    which we became familiar during the epidemics of 1918. Some cases    described clinically as    bronchitis were found at necropsy to have a lobular pneumonia which was    considered to have    supervened on the attack of bronchitis.      "Chronic    bronchitis" gave rise to a moderate discharge rate for disability and    to a certain    number of deaths. It appeared to follow "acute bronchitis" and to    represent those cases not    infrequently observed during the last war of the failure of the    bronchopneumonia to clear up, or    to those cases of bronchiectasis following influenza which have given    rise to some degree of    invalidism among the veterans. The necropsy reports are not    sufficiently definite to enable one to    judge of the pathologic condition present.      Under  "pneumonia" it is stated that many diseases were of more frequent    occurrence than    pneumonia, but only diarrhea and dysentery and the continued fevers    furnished a larger death    list. It was shown, however, in the discussion of the points of    interest connected with these grave    camp diseases, that pneumonia was present, and caused or hastened the    fatal issue in 21.6 percent of the deaths from diarrhea and dysentery    and in 68.3 per cent of    those attributed to the    continued fevers; the mortality from measles also resulted largely from    inflammatory processes    in the lungs.      Under    the title of pneumonia are described many cases of the various forms    including the    unfavorable terminations of abscess of the lung, gangrene, unresolved    pneumonia and    bronchiectasis. Some of these cases the physical signs of which    indicated a persistence of    consolidation were termed "chronic pneumonia" or "chronic interstitial    pneumonia."        Acute    hemorrhagic pneumonitis does not appear as such under the heading    pneumonia    but under that of fatal acute bronchitis, and it is quite clear that    the pathological entity is that    seen during the epidemic of September and October, 1918, in the United    States, and in a lesser    number of cases in the high respiratory incidence of the spring of the    same year.        The    high fatality in cases in which the pleura and pericardium were    involved is noted in    the general discussion. Practically every type of lesion seen during    the World War is described    in these protocols of the necropsies of the Civil War. Under secondary    pneumonia are included    a large proportion of those pulmonary inflammations which appeared at    the time to be entirely secondary, in fact the descriptions of the    clinical course indicate the presence of an acute    respiratory infection without severe embarrassment of respiration and    no physical signs of    pneumonia preceding the increased symptoms due to consolidation. The    clinical descriptions of    these cases correspond with those recorded during both the spring and    fall epidemics of 1918.    The clinicians and pathologists of that time considered that a primary    bronchitis was followed    by a distinct and separate disease, namely, pneumonia, and believed    that the first made the    patient more susceptible to the second rather than that they were    definite manifestations of the    same disease either in character or extent.        Under    pleurisy are recorded numerous fatal cases in most of which there was    general    involvement of the chest cavity. The records showed that no definite    differentiation was made    between mild pleuritic involvement and frank empyema.     6      MEXICAN BORDER    MOBILIZATION (1915-16)      During    the mobilization on the Mexican border of 1915-16, an epidemic of about    400    cases of pneumonia occurred among 40,000 troops with a 20 percent case    fatality. The    epidemiological and bacteriological characteristics of this outbreak    were described by Nichols.8 Pneumococci and streptococci were cultivated from the sputum. Type    determinations showed    pneumococcus Type I in 56 percent, Type II in 22 percent, Type III in    2 percent and Group IV    in 20 percent. Many of the troops were from Northern States where Type    I was prevalent in the    pneumonia of the camps in 1917. In view of our experience during 1917    and 1918, it is probable    that an acute respiratory infection preceded the pneumonia. Had this    not been so, a greater    proportion of the pneumonic lesions should have been caused by a single    type of organism,    though ill the present state of our knowledge, bacterial variation must    be considered. The lack of    all pathologic description prevents us from making a definite decision    as to the character of the    pulmonary inflammation which was recorded as lobar on the basis of    clinical observation. Direct    evidence of tent, company and regimental contagion was obtained. In    reporting the epidemic    Nichols made the following prophecy which was overlooked in the rush of    war preparation    taking place at the time of publication: "Epidemic lobar pneumonia is    to be expected in large    camps in the winter months."
