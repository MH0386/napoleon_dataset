Waterloo was one of the most decisive battles ever fought. It was a crucial event in European political and social history, ending over twenty years of conflict and bringing one of Europe’s most extraordinary and challenging figures to his knees.Napoleon Bonaparte (1803-10-15) by William DickinsonBritish MuseumNapoleonNapoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) rose to prominence as a brilliant young general during the late 1790s. This portrait shows him in 1802 at one of his finest moments; he had become First Consul in 1799, and in 1804 was to be crowned Emperor of the French. By the end of 1805 he had gained control of most of Europe.Preparing for War (1815) by George CruikshankBritish MuseumLead up to the battleThe beginning of the end for Napoleon came with his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. By the end of 1813 his armies had been defeated both by a coalition of nations at the Battle of Leipzig and by the Duke of Wellington’s forces in Spain. He abdicated in April 1814 and was exiled to Elba, but in March 1815 he was back in Paris and ready to confront the powers of Europe. A Grand Manoeuvre! or, The Rogues march to the Island of Elba, George Cruikshank, 1814-04-13, From the collection of: British MuseumShow lessRead moreThis print shows Napoleon dragged off by urchins to a boat which a devil will row to Elba.

The British were expecting support from Prussia, which was delayed due to mud and floods, meaning Napoleon very nearly broke through the British line before the Prussians intervened. Having gambled all on this last attempt, Napoleon’s defeat was catastrophic. Panorama of the Battlefield of Quatre Bras (1815-06-20) by Thomas StoneyBritish MuseumThe immediate aftermathJust a couple of days after the event Thomas Stoney created studies of the battlefield illustrating the most famous sites of the battle – Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte – and also rare views of the buildings at Quatra Bras. A shocking panorama of the battlefield, it is littered with unburied naked corpses, left to wash away into the ditches as often time was taken to only bury the bodies of officers. Panorama of the Battlefield of Quatre Bras (1815-06-20) by Thomas StoneyBritish MuseumTransparency. Exhibited at R. Ackermann’s in the Strand (1815-11-27) by Thomas RowlandsonBritish MuseumAfter WaterlooNapoleon’s defeat at Waterloo was greeted almost universally with relief: the war that had lasted for more than twenty years was finally over. But in Britain triumphalism was mixed with anxiety over the high price of war and sorrow for those lost. Napoleon escaped after the battle, abdicated a second time and made his way to Rochefort, hoping to sail for the United States.A Scene at the London Museum Piccadilly, George Cruikshank, 1816-01, From the collection of: British MuseumShow lessRead moreThe wild crowd at this exhibition seems to have forgotten the horror of the battlefield just six months earlier, and only a Frenchman in the background feels any sadness, weeping unrestrainedly as he looks at a bust of Napoleon.Origine de l’étouffoir impérial, Lacroix, 1815-08, From the collection of: British MuseumShow lessRead moreMany Frenchmen were pleased to see the back of Bonaparte, who represented eternal war for them just as much as he did for the British.

His only glimpse of Britain was from the deck of the ship and on 8 August he sailed for the remote island of St Helena in the south Atlantic where he spent the last six years of his life in exile.Credits: StoryThe concept for this online exhibition stems from Bonaparte and the British: prints and propaganda in the age of Napoleon an exhibition held at the British Museum, London from 5 February to 16 August 2015.
