The choice is due to the fact that they are taller and more resistant than the coaches, thus allowing long journeys and better adapting to the territory. They are also more stable due to their structure with two parallel beams and the box rests directly on the leather struts, which provides greater comfort for long journeys. It is believed that the Bed Berlin was one of the vehicles that went to Brazil and returned in 1821 along with the Portuguese royal family. In contrast to the other vehicles, this berlin has an aeration system, adapted to the high temperatures of Rio de Janeiro, where the glass panels have been replaced by leather - which can be opened with a pulley system.Landing of the Real Princess Leopoldina (1839 - 1839) by Jean Baptiste Debret (del.); Thierry Frères (lith.)Museu ImperialRoyal weddingA policy of European alliances negotiates the marriage of Prince D.
