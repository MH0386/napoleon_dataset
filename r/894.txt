He felt that his brother had sided too much with the Dutch and too little with the French Empire.Kaart van de inlijving bij Frankrijk, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreThe French EmpireHolland, despite a ban imposed by Napoleon, continued to trade with Britain.

It sparked off a wave of unrest.Verwoesting van het douanehuisje bij de Schreierstoren te Amsterdam, 1813, Koninklijke Steendrukkerij van C.W.

Presiding over the committee was Gijsbert Karel Van Hogendorp. Despite having been subject to a whole string of amendments in the intervening years, the present-day constitution can still be traced back to the original constitution of 1814.Beëdigen van de Grondwet op 30 maart 1814, 1814-03-30, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreCeremony for the 1814 ConstitutionGrondwet van 1814 (Eerste Grondwet) Voorkant, 1814-03-29, From the collection of: National Archives of The Netherlands, Grondwet van 1814 (Eerste Grondwet) Voorwoord, 1814-03-29, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreThe first constitution 'Wij Willem, ...' Click to see the document.Around a third of the articles in the 1814 constitution related to the king, and the whole constitution revolved around his sovereignty and supremacy. The 1814 constitution was the first of its kind in the kingdom, and its significance is primarily institutional: it provided a framework for a new, largely centrally governed unitary state.From now on, aspects of decentralisation would also be centrally determined.Grondwet van 1814 (Eerste Grondwet) Pagina 66 en 67, 1814-03-29, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreSignature by Bernhardus BumaOne of the ancestors of a Dutch a current politician, Sybrand van Haersma Buma, also signed the first Constitution: Bernhardus Buma.Bernhardus Buma, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreBernhardus BumaThe constitution of 24 August 1815In June 1815, a decision was made in London to join the Netherlands with the former Austrian Netherlands (Belgium).

Whilst in the North, approval for the new constitution was overwhelming, in the South the majority voted against it.Ultimately, the king decided that the constitution would be adopted, because those who had failed to turn up were deemed to have voted in favour (‘silence implies consent’), and because dissenting votes which had been cast with a view to rejecting the separation of church and state, were considered not to have been cast.The separation treaty with Belgium, 19 April 1839 (Treaty of London)  Right from the creation of the Kingdom in 1815, there are problems between King William I and the Southern Netherlands. Its inhabitants are predominantly Catholic as opposed to those of the Northern Netherlands, who are Protestant. What’s more, the north has a much larger public debt than the south. Opposition to William I continues to mount after he issues the language decree in 1823. From now on, Dutch is the only official language allowed to be used in the Flemish provinces.In 1830, things come to a head. What starts off as riots ends in a full-blown war. The Belgians form a temporary government which declares independence on 4 October. Shortly thereafter, Belgium is recognised by the European nations. But William I refuses to acknowledge the separation, which results in the Ten Day Campaign in August 1831. Whilst initially successful, the Dutch army is forced to withdraw following French intervention. The separation of the Netherlands and Belgium is now final.Overwinning voor Leuven, op den 12den Augustus 1831, 1813-08-12, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreTen days' campaignScheiding Nederland en België 1939 Scheiding Nederland en België 1939, 1839-04-19, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreThe seperation treaty of Belgium and The NetherlandsHowever, only in 1839 does William I reconcile himself to the situation and accept the separation treaty.Scheiding Nederland en België 1939 Pagina 4 en kaart van de provincie Luxemburg, 1839-04-19, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreThis map shows the Belgium territory that consists of the provinces Zuid-Brabant, Luik, Namen, Henegouwen, West-Vlaanderen and Oost-Vlaanderen.Scheiding Nederland en België 1939 Pagina 8 en kaart van Limburg, 1839-04-19, From the collection of: National Archives of The NetherlandsShow lessRead moreThis map refers to the territories mentioned in article IV.
