Philbrook, M. D., and John E. Gordon, M. D.   ARMY EXPERIENCE WITH DIARRHEAL DISORDERS BEFORE WORLD WAR II  Montgomery says the Eighth Army won, but      Rommel claimed the      victory for dysentery * * *.      But, as the Germans learned at El Alamein, dysentery can still win      battles, when hygiene      discipline on one side is slack.-SIR SHELDON F. DUDLEY. General Considerations  Throughout history, military populations have      experienced great morbidity by reason of the      diarrheas and dysenteries. As causes of illness and norneffectiveness,      these diseases have      plagued the United States Army since it was first organized. Until the      time of World War I, they      were important causes of mortality. Diarrheal disease was rampant among troops during           the Revolution and apparently was           responsible for more deaths than were caused by enemy action. Available           figures for the Civil           War indicate the military significance of this disease in combat           troops; diarrheas and dysenteries           "occurred with more frequency and produced more sickness and mortality           than any other form of           disease." More than 1,755,889 patients were admitted to field medical           installations and hospitals. For diarrheas and dysenteries, including           gastroenteritis, the case rate was 741.2 per annum per           1,000 average strength.Deaths were 46,277, representing a mortality           rate of 18 per 1,000; 2.6           percent of the men admitted for these causes died. During the Civil           War, more than 1 death in           every 4 caused by disease was ascribed to diarrheas and dysenteries. In           the Union Army, of           every 1,000 men the following numbers succumbed to dysentery or           diarrhea during each year of           the war; Negro troops fared worse than white troops:1  YearWhite troopsNegro troops1861-624.1701862-6315.9901863-6415.7843.541864-6521.2936.291865-6616.0026.97 1 Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion. Medical History. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1879, vol. 1, pt. II, pp. 1, 6, passim. 320  The dysenteric diseases are at their worst in    prisoner-of-war camps.The stockade for Union    prisoners of war at Andersonville, Ga., is an outstanding historical    example, to such extent that it    became known as the most fatal field in the War Between the States. At    least 16,772 cases of    diarrhea and dysentery occurred at this prison and represented an    estimated annual rate of 1,724    per 1,000 strength; 4,529 men died. More than one-half of all    fatalities were attributed to    diarrhea and dysentery.2 During the Spanish-American War, at the turn of the           20th century, the incidence of diarrheas and           dysenteries among United States Army troops was slightly lower than           that among troops during           the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. However, typhoid fever was           distinguished as a disease           problem because of a mortality far exceeding the more frequent but less           deadly related           dysenteric illnesses. Indeed, diarrhea and dysentery seemed in this war           to have lost much of their           killing power. During the war years of 1898-1901, 204,040 admissions           were, reported           representing a rate of 426 admissions per 1,000 troops. The number of           deaths was 1,595, a rate of           3.3 per 1,000. Case fatality dropped to 0.78 percent in this period.           Diarrheal disease occurred in           severe epidemic form in United States Army troops in the Philippines           shortly after the American           occupation in 1899-1900. Much of the excess incidence was doubtless due           to bacillary           dysentery, but typhoid fever was the more serious problem in terms of           resulting deaths. At the           time of the Spanish- American War, attention was focused upon typhoid           fever with a resultant           improvement in diagnosis of this enteric condition. Examination of data           of this and other wars           suggests that many, fatal intestinal infections of earlier wars were in           reality typhoid fever,           erroneously diagnosed as infections within the group of diarrheas and           dysenteries (including           gastroenteritis). Comparison of experience in World War II with that of           former wars must take           this into account.             During World War I, the Army benefited from the   great improvements in environmental   sanitation of the preceding two decades. During the period from April   1917 to December 1919,   there occurred in the overseas Army 48,202 admissions for diarrheal   disease, including   gastroenteritis, a rate of 28.9 admissions per 1,000 troops. There were   only 208 deaths (0.13   deaths per 1,000 troops) which represents the best record up to that   time in any American war.   Case fatality was 0.43 percent. The improvement in respect to typhoid   fever was even more   startling (table 82).This favorable downward trend of cases and deaths   of typhoid fever   continued throughout World War II, but the rate of 40 cases of reported   dysenteries and   diarrheas (excluding gastroenteritis) per 1,000 strength in total   troops overseas certainly shows   no appreciable improvement over World War I experience. However, a   comparison of the Army   in continental United States and in the European Theater 2  Medicaland SurgicalHistory of the War of the Rebellion. Medical History. Washington:Government PrintingOffice, 1885, vol. 1, pt. 111, p. 35.321 of Operations, with troops of World War I, is more justifiable andreveals that deaths fromdiarrheas and dysenteries followed a downward trend in World War II,reasonably reflecting theimproved sanitation of America and Europe. During World War II, ascontrasted with WorldWar I, a greater proportion of combat troops were sent to tropical orsemitropical regions withHigh endemicity for dysenteric diseases and a low standard ofsanitation. The rate of 18 casesper 1,000 strength for the Zone of Interior in World War I is to becompared with 9 cases per1,000 for World War II (table 54). The enteric disease rate amongoverseas troops in World WarI, approximately 29 cases per 1,000 troops per annum, may properly becompared with the rateamong troops in the European theater in World War 11, 14 cases per1,000 troops per annum. The rates for World War II are about one-halfthose of World War I. By the same standards, thecase rates for typhoid fever dropped in World War If to less thanone-tenth of the rates for thisdisease in World War I for the total Army, and to approximatelyone-twentieth of the World WarI rates for this disease among United States Army troops in Europe.Typhoid case rates amongthe United States Army at home became an almost insignificant 0.006case per 1,000 troops perannum. Marked improvement also occurred in respect to the paratyphoidfevers.    During World War II, deaths ascribed to diarrheas           and dysenteries (including also           gastroenteritis, ileitis, and ulcerative colitis) totaled 116. Using           the 523,331 cases reported on           WD MD Form 86ab, Statistical Health Report, (not including cases           diagnosed as gastroenteritis)           the deaths represent a case fatality of 0.022 percent. The death rate           of 0.005 per 1,000 strength is           considerably less than the rate in World War I.   In comparing current experience with past Army   history of these diseases, due consideration   must be given to the fact that earlier data often were based on   hospital admissions alone, whereas   World War II morbidity statistics include all patients, whether sick in   quarters or admitted to   hospital. Although reporting is still far from complete,   the general level of reporting is better   than in former wars. World War II data for common diarrheas are   considerably increased by   these factors, while the more severe illnesses such as the dysenteries   (when diagnosed as such)   and typhoid fever are probably little affected, since most patients   with these diseases would have   been admitted to hospital even in former wars. As a result, more mild   cases of diarrheal disease   probably have crept into statistical records of recent wars as compared   with earlier wars. This   factor must be considered in evaluating both incidence of disease and   effectiveness of medical   care. With the reporting of a larger number of mild cases and better   medical care, case fatality   rates fell to almost insignificant levels, despite the high morbidity   reported in several theaters of   operations in World War II. Nevertheless, control of the diarrhea's and   dysenteries has not kept   pace with that accomplished for typhoid fever. 322 TABLE 54.âIncidence ofdiarrheaand dysentery in the U. S. Army, by area and year, 1940-45andtotal for the years 1942-45 1  323 TABLE 54.-Incidence of diarrhea and dysentery in theU.S. Army, byarea and year, 1940-45 and total for the years 1942-451-Continued324    Classification  For the purposes of this analysis, the diarrheas   and dysenteries are classified as common   diarrheas and dysenteries (protozoal, bacillary, and unclassified)   according to the diagnostic.   titles set forth in statistical health reports.    The common diarrheas (as defined in Army Regulations           No. 40-1080) include a variety of           infections of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown cause, such as           colitis, enterocolitis, enteritis,           diarrhea, mucous colitis, intestinal indigestion, sigmoiditis, and           intestinal toxemia (when           associated with diarrhea). Grouping these infections under this single           inclusive title has an           advantage over the practice of former years when each clinical entity           had individual           consideration irrespective of admittedly inexact anatomic or           symptomatic criteria for diagnosis. All these infections are now           grouped within the single category of the common diarrheas. Too           little is known about these several conditions, and the criteria for           differentiation are too inexact           to warrant continued separation in the course of attempts to describe           the diarrheal disorders of an           army or another population.      Diagnostic and       microbiologic interrelationship.-One or another of these terms,       and also that of       gastroenteritis, is often used provisionally for infections suspected       to be of specific bacterial       origin. Bacteriologic diagnosis ultimately determines a number of such       infections as being       bacillary dysentery, amebic dysentery, or instances of salmonellosis.       As for the remainder, much       of what is now grouped under the common diarrheas is in all probability       dysentery of unknown       etiology, unknown because a search for an etiologic agent either was       not made or was reported       negative.    The proportion of common diarrheas actually           representative of protozoal or bacillary dysentery           can only be estimated from limited data in a few theaters where           laboratory surveys were made. The important consideration is that no           practical analysis of dysenteric disease nor specific           consideration of bacillary dysentery is either reasonable or feasible           unless the common diarrheas           are included. This opinion is held despite recognition that diagnostic           titles included in the           common diarrheas do not in their entirety represent enteric infections           or intoxications due to           known specific microbial agents. Through unofficial statements of           former Army medical           officers, it is known, for example, that acute alcoholism was recorded           occasionally under one or           another of the diagnostic titles included in the common diarrheas, or           as gastroenteritis, because           of the stigma attached to the straightforward diagnosis. The important           fact remains that, when           careful laboratory studies were made, a major part of the common           diarrheas as seen in World           War II could be demonstrated as due to Shigella, Salmonella, or           Endamoeba histolytica. Many           epidemic peaks of common diarrhea coincide in time with recognized           outbreaks of shigellosis.                Clinical       interrelationship.-The entities       included in the mixed group of anatomic and       symptomatic diagnostic titles, known collectively as the common       diarrheas, seemingly have       much in common in their clinical manifestations with325 diseases distinguished etiologically as either bacillary or amebicdysentery. Diarrhea is thetypical symptom, often of sudden onset: and brief duration, and isaccompanied by varyingdegrees of tenesmus and abdominal pain and followed by rapid recovery.The common diarrheasare characterized by an extremely low fatality. The few deathsattributed to common diarrhea arepresumably the result of failure to recognize a more serious infectionsuch as bacillary or amebicdysentery. Specific etiologic agents are by definition undetermined.    Epidemiologic           interrelationships.-Epidemiologically, the behavior of common diarrhea           is           suggestive of an infection, and transmission in the great,           preponderance of cases is by the same           general meats, through ingestion of food or drink. The occurrence of           most of diem reflects           directly or indirectly the general level of environmental sanitation           under which different army           units existed or of the countries or specific locations in which troops           were deployed. Occurrence           in close correlation with known specific, infectious diarrheal diseases           suggests similar           epidemiologic mechanisms. Many epidemic peaks coincide time with           recognized outbreaks of           shigellosis. Incidence was high in theaters of operations when the           environment was poorly           sanitated and bacillary and amebic dysenteries were common diseases.           Incidence was low in           theaters or environmental situations where known specific agents of           diarrheal diseases were           infrequent. The rigid application of sanitary principles, especially in           relation to food and drink,           to feces disposal, and to fly control reduced the risk of the common           diarrheas in equal degree as           it lowered the incidence of the dysenteries.  Titles not   included.-Some 10 other diagnostic titles or diseases are   variously included in   classifications of diarrheal disease, none of which are represented in   this analysis. Brief   consideration is given to possible effects of their exclusion on   comparisons of the present data   with diarrheal disease in former wars and in some instances on   comparisons between theaters of   World War II.    The diagnostic title of gastroenteritis is not           included among diarrheas and dysenteries as           presented in table 54. Statistics of former wars often included           gastroenteritis, an addition           materially affecting comparisons. Separate, data on the incidence of           gastroenteritis are riot           available for the first 2 years of World War II, but it is estimated           that approximately 350,000           cases occurred during the 4 war years. If these cases had been included           among diarrheas and           dysenteries of World War II, the total would be more than 850,000, and           incidence would exceed           34 per 1,000 per annum, a rate somewhat greater than the 29 for the           United States Army in           Europe during World War I.      Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers and bacterial food       poisoning if they were reported as such are       not here included. They are considered elsewhere in this volume. Army       units were instructed in       October 1943 to record bacterial food poisoning as a separate item, and       the diagnostic title was       added to the Statistical Health Report (WD) MD Form 86ab of 22 August       1940) when the report       was revised in 1944. Before October 1943, bacterial food poisoning had       been included under       common diarrhea, and undoubtedly a considerable pro-326     portion of cases continued to be so reported after this date.3 The extent to which the new system           of reporting was followed in the several theaters of operations and the           promptness with which it           was adopted were doubtless subject to much variation. Better results           were undoubtedly obtained           in areas where epidemiologic investigation and laboratory diagnosis           were readily available           services. Current statistical information on typhoid and paratyphoid           fevers can be accepted as           reliable, since diagnosis depends almost universally upon demonstration           of the etiologic agent. That this reliability factor was not always           present must be taken into consideration when           comparing incidence (of either these specific diseases or the diarrheas           and dysenteries) in World           War II with that of earlier wars.                Also excluded from specific and separate           consideration here are such entities as diarrhea and           dysentery of presumed viral etiology such as epidemic viral           gastroenteritis or acute infectious           gastroenteritis or winter vomiting disease or vomiting and diarrhea           syndrome, as described by           numerous authors during and since World War II.  There conditions doubtless played an important   role in the World War II Army and will in the   Army of the future. As more becomes known about them, they may become   subject to separate   statistical analysis, but during World War II their recognition and   reporting was not specifically   accomplished. Viral etiology was suspected in several theaters, and   some attempts that were   made to recover these agents are described in this chapter. Such   entities during World War II   were merely given one or another of the common diarrhea diagnoses or   were considered to be   cases of gastroenteritis or unclassified dysentery. Factors Affecting Reporting ofSpecific Dysenteries  By regulation, the diagnosis of bacillary and   amebic dysentery during World War II was   contingent on recovery or identification of the bacillus or ameba, a   practice that did not hold in   former wars. Instances of clinical dysentery associated with pus,   mucus, and possibly blood in   the stools were designated "dysentery, unclassified," in the absence of   microbiologic   confirmation. In general, the frequency of etiologic diagnosis of   bacillary or protozoal dysentery   was a reflection of the amount and quality of laboratory work.    The techniques necessary for identification of E.               histolytica are relatively simple, compared with           those of determinative bacteriology. As a consequence, the search for           protozoal agents of           diarrheal disease was usually more exhaustive than that for bacillary           agents and probably           accounted for the greater frequency with which amebic dysentery was           recognized. A significant           proportion of many populations are carriers of E. histolytica,           estimated by Mackie           3 Gordon, J. E.: AHistory of Preventive Medicine in the European Theater of Operations,U. S. Army, 1941-45.[Official record.]327 and others 4 as 9.8 percent for theUnited States andin excess of 50 percent for poorly sanitatedregions of the Tropics and subtropics. An even larger number arecarriers of protozoa closelyresembling E. histolytica. The diagnosis of amebicdysentery was in all probability frequentlymade when the true infectious agent was an unsought Shigella. Personswithout clinicalsymptoms are known to have been treated with a view to eliminating the Endamoeba,and somewere given the diagnosis of amebic dysentery. For these reasons, theincorrect diagnosis ofcommon diarrhea was made less frequently for cases of amebic dysenterythan for cases ofbacillary dysentery. Small numbers of patients with common diarrhealdiseases and shigellosiswere in all likelihood erroneously designated as suffering from amebicdysentery. The tendencywas to over report amebic dysentery and to under report bacillaryinfections.    The biologic gradient of clinical bacillary           dysentery ranges from severe infections (in the           diagnosis of which the physician is prompted to seek laboratory aid, or           which he may diagnose           as unclassified dysentery, enteritis, gastroenteritis, or           enterocolitis) to instances of lesser           severity, with symptoms largely absent or attended by no more than mild           diarrhea. The tendency           is to give the diagnosis of common diarrhea to these mild infections           or, because of vague           symptomatology, to call them gastroenteritis, enteritis, or colitis.           For reasons already presented,           this probably applies to amebic dysentery in lesser degree. Other           features presumably account           for varying frequencies of confirmed dysentery.  Adequate laboratory facilities and competent   personnel were not uniformly available in all   theaters of operations. Furthermore, the interests of medical officers   varied. A specific concern   about amebiasis by medical officers in one location was followed by a   relatively high incidence   of that type of infection. In another theater, an epidemiologic team   had a specific interest in   shigellosis, with the result that a relatively high incidence of   bacillary dysentery was uncovered. Each of these circumstances led to   the separation of a higher percentage of the entity on which   interest was focused from the common diarrheas, gastroenteritis, and   unclassified dysentery   classifications. For example, one factor accounting for the reported   high incidence of amebic   dysentery in a part of the Mediterranean theater was said to have been   the result of interest of   certain medical officers in amebiasis.5 The arrival of   several groups studying diarrheal disease   and the development of special health record forms for amebiasis in the   China-Burma-India   theater doubtless stimulated search for cases and carriers.    The true incidence of bacillary dysentery represents           a sizeable proportion of the common           diarrheas, of unclassified dysentery, and of gastroenteritis together           with those cases reported as           bacillary dysenteries; hence the practicality and feasibility of           presenting combined information           for diarrhea and  4 Mackie,Thomas T.,Hunter, George W., III. and Worth, C. Brooke: Manual of TropicalMedicine. Philadelphia:W. B. Saunders Co., 1945, p. 191. 5 Gilmore,   H. R.: Final   Report of the Preventive Medicine Officer, Office of the Surgeon,   Mediterranean Theater of   Operations, U. S. Army, 1 January-31 October 1945. [Official   record.]328    dysentery as a class or group. Justification for this procedure isfound in the situation in theMediterranean theater in 1943. The annual rate for diarrheas anddysenteries was 132 cases per1,000 troops (table 54). The rate for bacillary dysentery was only 6.22cases (table 59), despitethe presence that year of a theater wide epidemic ascribed to bacillarydysentery. Surveysrevealed that Shigella could be recovered from a highpercentage of the cases of commondiarrhea in the Fifth U. S. Army.6 During the same year,three other theaters with no recognizedgeneral epidemic of bacillary dysentery actually reported higher ratesfor that disease.Two hadlaboratories especially active in recovering dysentery bacilli fromsuspected cases. In the China-Burma India theater, several hundredconsecutive admissions for diarrhea were examined in ageneral hospital in Assam and in two dispensaries. Dysentery bacilliwere demonstrated byculture of material obtained by a single rectal swab in 24 percent ofthe hospital cases acid in 16percent of the dispensary infections. Multiple cultures doubtless wouldhave increased thosepercentages. "As would be expected, the number of positive findings inthe series of dispensarycases is less than in the hospital series. These cases were mild, andhad cultures riot been madethey would have beers classed as common diarrheas." 7    Because of the differences in diagnostic practice           just described and because facilities for           laboratory work were so uneven, the various clinical entities among           intestinal infections cannot           be compared individually with what happened in former wars nor, in some           instances, can any           reasonable comparison be made between theaters of operations of World           War II.     Method, of Presentation of Data  The most useful approach appears to be a study of   diarrheas and dysenteries as a single group of   diseases and as they occurred in the several theaters of operations. In   the following presentation   of analyses, the practical purpose of the study-to provide a basis for   future experience in the   event that United States troops should again be deployed in the areas   involved is kept constantly   in view. Bacillary dysentery is given special consideration in this   presentation: other specific;   diarrheal diseases are presented in separate chapters. Individual   attention is given the dysenteries   so far as the data permit. Proved cases of bacillary dysentery are a   part of this report; amebic   dysentery, although given some general consideration here, is the   subject of a separate chapter.    Grouping the diarrheas and dysenteries in a combined           statistical presentation is judged a           practical and feasible approach to the descriptive epidemiology of           dysenteric disease. A           compilation of the Medical Statistics Division, Office of the Surgeon           General, entitled           "Morbidity and Mortality in the United States Army, 1940-45," is the           source of most of the data           now presented (table 54 and charts 28, 30, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 46, and           47). These statistics           enumerate the diarrheas and dysenteries as they were diagnosed and           reported currently and 6 FifthArmy MedicalService History, 1944. 7 Progressand FinalReport, Sub-Commission on Dysentery.

Such datatherefore do not tally identicallywith those derived from statistical tabulations of individual medicalrecords. They do provide anexcellent basis for epidemiologic description of the picture as itunfolded in the several theatersof operations during World War II. For such separate consideration aswill be given to individualdiagnostic entities comprising the group, especially bacillarydysentery (table 59), the majorsource of statistical data is various tabulations of individual medicalrecords as compiled by theOffice of the Surgeon General. In general, admissions data are used forthe common diarrheasand incidence rates for the specific and unclassified dysenteries.    The epidemiologic description of the diarrheas and           dysenteries in each major theater of           operations or area will be followed by a consideration of available           information on bacillary           dysentery. Experience From 1935 to 1941  During the years from 1935 to 1939 inclusive,   Army troops stationed within the United States   were a relatively stable population, living under sanitary conditions   reasonably comparable to   those of better sanitated civilian communities. The incidence of   diarrheal disease was low, and   rates were remarkably uniform from year to year (table 55). For the   decade of the 1930's,   incidence rates were within the range of 5 or fewer cases per 1,000 men   as illustrated in chart 27.   During the latter half of the, period, annual TABLE55.-Incidence of intestinalinfections including common diarrhea and dysentery (alltypes),peacetimeArmy in continental United States, by month,1935-39  330 incidence varied from 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1,000 per annum and theaverage was 3 cases.Thehighest rates were in summer, August being the peak month; winter rateswere lowest, with ausual seasonal increase in late spring. Diarrheal disease presented afavorable and stabilizedsituation. CHART27.-Incidenceof diarrheaand dysentery in the Army in the continental United States, 1930-42   The incidence of   diarrheal disease in troops in the continental United States rose   rather sharply   to 13 cases per 1,000 per annum for the 2 years 1940 and 1941 (chart   27). These were the years   of preparation for war, with more than fourfold expansion of the Army.   Raw recruits and   untrained men were brought together from all parts of the Nation, and   they engaged in active   field training and maneuvers. In 1940 and 1941, diarrheal disease rates   were 7 cases and 15   cases, respectively, per 1,000 troops (table 54). For the same years,   rates for the total Army (both   overseas and in continental United States) were also 7 and 15, which   shows that the bulk of the   problem was in the Zone of Interior rather than overseas. Overseas   troops had slightly higher   rates of 9 and 17, but less than 12 percent of the average strength of   this expanding Army was   stationed overseas, chiefly in the Philippines with rates of 27 and 28   cases, respectively, per   1,000 per annum and in the Antilles Department (Latin American area)   with rates of 34 and 26   cases, respectively, per 1,000 per annum. The well-established program   of sanitation and   military preventive medicine in the Panama Canal Department proved its   worth, for during these   2 years the rate was 3 cases per 1,000 per annum.    That field training           contributed heavily to the incidence of diarrheal disorders in the       United States       is evidenced by the North Carolina maneuvers of August and September       1941. The entire Army       had 8,890 cases in those 2 months; a total of 8,297 cases were in the       continental United States; a       large proportion was related to an outbreak of bacillary dysentery in       the course of these       maneuvers. Continental rates for these 2 months were 35 and 37 per       1,000 per annum (chart 28),       rates higher by far than for any month in the European theater or for       the Panama Canal Zone, the       North American area, or the Alaskan Department at any time in World War       II. However, these  331 monthly rates were exceeded at onetime or another in all tropical or subtropical areas of militaryoperations, with the single exception of the Panama Canal Zone.
