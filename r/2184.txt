Who were the doctors of the ‘Petit Caporal ’?Related storiesHISTORYNapoleon, the taller than average 'Corsican ogre'CINEMARidley Scott lashes back against French after ‘Napoleon’ criticismDr. François Carlo Antommarchi, Napoleon’s Corsican compatriot, was the emperor’s personal doctor in his last years in exile, where he arrived already ill and in which his state of health declined, eventually leading to his death. When Antommarchi landed on the island in 1819, Napoleon already saw death up close. The emperor never trusted the abilities of the Corsican doctor, but still entrusted him with the power to perform his autopsy, in order to prevent his son from a disease that the French leader believed to be hereditary. Antommarchi’s autopsy report mentioned the emperor’s liver as “very large and distended with blood and affected by chronic hepatitis” although that was contested by some of the five British doctors who signed the one-page autopsy report. From 1804 to 1814, the decade in which Napoleon was Emperor of France, the doctor who was assigned to and personally attended to Le Petit Caporal was Jean-Nicolas Corvisart, a French doctor who had a prestigious career. earning a great reputation as a cardiologist and who died the same year as the emperor - just two months later.Tagged in:Napoleón BonaparteObituariosTubérculosTuberculosisMédicosCommentRulesSign in to commentAlready have an accountWe recommend these for you in EntertainmentENTERTAINMENTWhat is Gisele Bündchen’s net worth?
