Its fame is for good reason. This portrait is radically different from other contemporary portraits such as those created by David, Gros, Gérard and Girodet.  Napoleon I on the Imperial Throne Face detailMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Inspired by Byzantine icons, Napoleon is depicted here from a front view, with porcelain skin and an impenetrable expression, wearing a laurel crown on his head, similar to the emperors of Ancient Rome.  Ermine fur, which is a royal symbol, lines his cloak and forms the ruff on which the collar of the Grand Master of the Order of the Legion of honor is presented.    The purple robe is decorated with bees, which symbolize immortality and resurrection.  Considered to be the oldest emblem of French sovereigns, they were chosen by Napoleon to bind the new dynasty to the origins of France. Napoleon I on the Imperial Throne General viewMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides The symbolic effect is reinforced by Napoleon's imposing throne, which forms a halo around his head. This made the Napoleon rendered by Ingres an almost divine power.   In his right hand, Napoleon holds the Hand of Justice—an element of regalia, the most significant of all royal emblems, and a symbol of judicial power. The original was destroyed during the French Revolution, so a perfect replica was made specially in 1804 for Napoleon's coronation.In his left hand is Charlemagne's scepter, which symbolizes executive power. This gold scepter is topped with a statuette of Charlemagne seated on a throne, wearing an imperial crown and also holding a scepter and an orb—a Christian symbol—all arranged over a fleur-de-lis.   By his side is Charlemagne's sword, known as the Joyeuse (Joyous). It was used to represent military power in the coronations of French Kings. Previously decorated with fleur-de-lis, Napoleon had the sword covered with precious stones for his coronation in 1804.  Once he was declared Emperor in 1804, Napoleon had to choose his emblem: he opted for the Eagle. Tied to Ancient Rome, the Eagle is associated with power and military victories. On the day after his coronation, Napoleon had his emblem placed on all the flags of his armies.Napoleon I on the Imperial Throne Eagle detail, From the collection of: Musée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Show lessRead moreThis decoration includes unexpected elements, such as a medallion depicting a set of scales, which denote judicial power, and the signs of the zodiac. Further down, there is a reference to the Madonna della Sedia painting by Raphael, a great painter of the Italian Renaissance for whom Ingres showed his admiration with an official portrait. Napoleon I on the Imperial Throne Face detailMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides  Many wonder about the meaning of the stars framing the Emperor's face.Napoleon I on the Imperial Throne General viewMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Just like these two spheres, one is in the light, while the other is barely visible in the shadows. These parts of the throne are often attributed to Masonic symbols. This piece has far from revealed all of its secrets.Napoleon I on the Imperial Throne Face detailMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides "How, with so much talent, precise drawing skills, and exquisite accuracy, did Ingres manage to create such a bad painting?" Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Chaussard, author, in 1806.  Napoleon I on the Imperial Throne General viewMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Deemed to be strange and provocative, the picture proved to be less successful than expected in 1806: the Emperor's face lacked realism due to its waxy appearance. However, almost 215 years later, this portrait is one of the key pieces in our collections!  Credits: StoryA story written and edited by the teams of the Army Museum.  © Musée de l’Armée   https://www.musee-armee.fr/accueil.htmlCredits: All mediaThe story featured may in some cases have been created by an independent third party and may not always represent the views of the institutions, listed below, who have supplied the content.Musée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Stories from Musée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitAnimals in the First World WarMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitVictoryMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online Exhibit5 Invalides secrets    Musée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitNormandy LandingsMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitPropaganda and liesMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitSaint-Louis by Charles de La FosseMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitThe tomb of Marshal FochMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitMuseum of Great Men     Musée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitGeneral de Lariboisière Bidding Farewell to his Son by Antoine-Jean GrosMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Online ExhibitEuropean Heritage DaysMusée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Translate with GoogleGoogle apps
