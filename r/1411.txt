What We Know.It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that the British royal family is in utter chaos right now, and on top of everything else (read: Kate Middleton‚Äôs Photoshop scandal), there are now rumors of an impending Regency. Emphasis on rumors‚Äîthe Palace hasn‚Äôt indicated at all that this could happen. But just in case a #RoyalAnnouncement does end up having to do with a Regent taking over King Charles‚Äôs royal duties, let‚Äôs familiarize ourselves with what that even means.First Things First: What Is a Regent?Gonna let Merriam-Webster step in here. The dictionary defines a Regent as ‚Äúa person who governs a kingdom in the minority, absence, or disability of the sovereign.‚Äù In other words, if King Charles can‚Äôt perform his royal duties due to illness, a Regent will temporarily step in and England will enter a Regency.WPA Pool - Getty ImagesIs a Regency the Same as an Abdication?No! Why? Because if there is a Regency, King Charles would still technically be king.Has a Regency Happened Before?Sure has! When George III was declared unfit to rule, his son George IV took over and England entered a Regency Era from 1811 to 1820.UniversalImagesGroup - Getty Images^It's called quiet luxury.So Who Would Take Over for Charles?The Regency Act of 1937 has it all laid out. First of all, a bunch of official people have to ‚Äúdeclare in writing‚Äù that the Sovereign is ‚Äúby reason of infirmity of mind or body incapable for the time being of performing the royal functions.‚Äù Once the paperwork is in order, the Soverign‚Äôs ‚Äúfunctions shall be performed in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign by a Regent.‚ÄùSpecifically, the Regent is the ‚Äúnext in the line of succession to the Crown‚Äù...so, this guy:Max Mumby/Indigo - Getty ImagesThe only way Prince William wouldn‚Äôt be Regent is if he were ‚Äúdisqualified.‚Äù And disqualification would only happen if the person in question (William, in this case) wasn‚Äôt a British subject, wasn‚Äôt living in the United Kingdom, wasn‚Äôt an adult, or was ‚Äúincapable‚Äù of inheriting the crown.This seems unlikely, but if William ever were to be disqualified, the next in line for Regent would be the person ‚Äúwho would have become Regent if the events necessitating the Regency had occurred immediately after the death or disqualification.‚Äù So...Prince Harry!Story continuesSamir Hussein - Getty ImagesWhat Would Prince William‚Äôs Title Be?If we go by George IV‚Äôs title as Regent, William would be known as ‚ÄúPrince Regent.‚ÄùWhat About the ‚ÄúCounsellors of State‚Äù?Under the 1937 Regency Act, the monarch‚Äôs spouse (Queen Camilla) as well as the next four adults in line to the throne (Prince William, Prince Harry, Prince Andrew, and Princess Beatrice) can be‚Äîaccording to The Telegraph‚Äî‚Äúdeployed as counsellors of state on official business.‚ÄùBut this isn‚Äôt the same as a Regency. Counsellors of State are typically used on a temporary basis‚Äîlike when Prince William and then-Prince Charles attended the State Opening of Parliament on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II, pictured below.WPA Pool - Getty ImagesAccording to University College London, Counsellors of State also have some major restrictions. For example they can‚Äôt appoint a Prime Minister or dissolve Parliament when stepping into the monarch‚Äôs shoes.Oh, and just FYI, back in September 2022, King Charles began the process of changing up his Counsellors of State list to make it only working members of the royal family‚Äî meaning Prince Harry, Prince Andrew, and Princess Beatrice wouldn‚Äôt be able to take over for him on a temporary basis.‚ÄôKay, that‚Äôs all‚Äîyou are now an expert on all things Regency in case anyone asks!Bet You‚Äôre Pretty Curious About Prince Harry‚Äôs Net Worth, Huh?Photo credit: Ben A.
