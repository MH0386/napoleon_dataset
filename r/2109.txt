The History of the Monarchy Government        When the unmonied poor rose up in the late 1700s, it was the culmination of years of starvation and deprivation under French rulers and noblemen. It was hoped that with the end of the monarchy there would be an end to the wars, unfair taxation and excess draining the French economy. The people wanted to improve their economic fortunes. Instead of improving, France descended further into corruption and chaos, and ushered in the rise of a new dictator -- Napoleon.   Causes of the French Revolution Before the revolution, France had undertaken an enormous amount of debt due years of war with England. The tax burden fell mostly on the peasants, who were taxed for nearly everything they did -- including being taxed for the number of children they had in their families. The nobles refused to be taxed according to their wealth. Immediately before the Revolution broke out, the nobility tried to reform the tax code but were unsuccessful. The tax issues and the financial burden were compounded by a famine in the years prior to the revolution.  Change in Government Before the king was deposed, the assembly had shown great unity in standing up to the king, and demanding the right to meet. After King Louis XVI was deposed, a republic was established, and the people of France were to be governed largely by a national assembly. But factions within the National Assembly, rather than work together to solve the debt crisis, and avoid war with numerous other nations in Europe, fought with each other instead. This infighting led to two years called The Terror, in which nearly 17,000 people died.    Corruption and Chaos of the Republic After 1795, the republic was governed by five men, called the Directorate, and the National Assembly. The nation appeared to be in on the road back to recovery and prosperity. But the men who ruled the Directorate were corrupt, and there was constant infighting. War expenses were actually propping the economy up. If the soldiers returned home, there would be an influx of people who needed jobs, so the Directorate prolonged wars with other countries to stay in power. The directors frustrated the assembly's attempts at reform, and the economy nearly ground to a halt.  The Rise of Napoleon In the midst of the chaos, fighting one of the many wars France was engaged in on the European continent, was Napoleon Bonaparte. He provided the strong military leadership that was needed when factions within the French government decided to overthrow the Directorate. The Directorate was replaced by three consuls, and as one of the consuls, Napoleon swiftly began to rewrite laws, calm the chaos, stem the corruption, and bring stability back to the country. He also achieved victories against France's continental enemies and brought peace to France for the first time in years. The price however, was an eventual loss of freedom for the people of France, as Napoleon had himself crowned emperor in 1804.
