It’s such a tiny dot in such an enormous ocean, that it seemed nothing short of a miracle that we found it at all! As we approached, its volcanic mountainous slopes, rising sheer out of the water, looked too forbidding and inhospitable to be able to support anything much, let alone a population of around 3,500 people.But when we landed we found a wonderfully diverse and friendly place and in the space of only 10 miles diameter you can travel (slowly-you don’t get above 3rd gear) from semi-arid desert to high peaks bathed in cloud and covered in lush green vegetation. So that if you don’t look too closely and realise that you could hardly name a single tree, you might be somewhere in the Alps - if not a tropical rainforest, or even on the moon. We drove up the scary, winding roads to the local community hall - just like us at home except for the fabulously starlit sky, and the serenade of frogs that greeted us.And then there’s the little patch of France that is forever Napoleon, but that’s another story…Credits:{a} Yoda, in ‘The Empire Strikes Back’{b} Seamus Talbot-Phibbs, in ‘A guide to some walks on the island of St Helena’@@FNCRRETADV@@Footnotes:{1} Prison where Nelson Mandela was held.{2} Not to be confused with ‘Disneyland’, as did The Daily Express in November 2023.{3} Where Napoleon was first exiled in May 1814.
