The result was a disaster for the French.The Russian army refused to engage with Napoleonâs Grande ArmÃ©e of more than 500,000 European troops. They simply retreated into the Russian interior. The Grande ArmÃ©e did not have the supplies or the distribution networks required for such a long march. French strategists assumed the Grande ArmÃ©e would be supplied by wagons, or would be able to gather supplies as they went. Russian roads, however, were in very poor condition, making it very difficult to transport supplies. The Grande ArmÃ©e also failed to prepare for Russiaâs harsh winter. Its troops were not dressed or trained for the kind of weather they faced.The invasion lasted six months, and the Grande ArmÃ©e lost more than 300,000 men. Russia lost more than 200,000. A single battle (the Battle of Borodino) resulted in more than 70,000 casualties in one day. The invasion of Russia effectively halted Napoleonâs march across Europe, and resulted in his first exile, to the Mediterranean island of Elba.CreditsMedia CreditsThe audio, illustrations, photos, and videos are credited beneath the media asset, except for promotional images, which generally link to another page that contains the media credit.
