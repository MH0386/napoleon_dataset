The prosperity of a country mainly lies in the education of her population. It is said that education is the backbone of a nation. Unfortunately though, the issue of educating girls does not get the priority it deserves. One of the most common barriers to the implementation of female education is early marriage–an unwelcome phenomenon which we have failed to eradicate from the society. Around half the total population in our country comprises of women. A country cannot achieve prosperity avoiding this large part of population. From this perspective, female education is a must. Education of a child greatly depends upon its mother. An educated mother would be able to bring up her child properly by installing good values in them that she acquired on the path of her learning. Social responsibilities should also be shared between men and women.       In conjugal life, a woman can help her husband in every sector of life. She can earn too so that the husband doesn’t have all pressures on his shoulder. Therefore, it’s important that woman should be educated. There are still some people who are strongly opposed to the female education. They think that women’s only duty is to do household affairs and rearing children. Empowered woman can enlighten the whole nation through her knowledge. Hence, we cannot think of progress of our country without the education of female. So, all necessary steps should be taken to encourage female education for the betterment of the country. Most disturbing scenario is that dropout rate is higher for female than the male students. There is a wide disparity between male and female in respect of completion rate, dropout rate and survival rate. According to a research, if we look at different location segments the higher rates of enrolments were observed in the metropolitan area, while the lower rates of enrolments were found to be in rural areas. Investing in girls’ education transforms communities, countries and the entire world. Girls who receive an education are less likely to marry young and more likely to lead healthy, productive lives. They earn higher incomes, participate in the decisions that most affect them, and build better futures for themselves and their families. Girls’ education strengthens economies and reduces inequality. It contributes to more stable, resilient societies that give all individuals – including boys and men – the opportunity to fulfil their potential education should never be looked at as a waste. Still many believe a one-off bride price is of more value than the life-time opportunities afforded by education. Unfortunately, they don’t understand that education is much more than a series of instructions in a classroom in the learning years rather education refines and reforms you. An educated woman is a better decision-maker, a better citizen, a better co-worker, a better woman because education opens up a wide range of opportunities to the building of a strong woman.      An educated woman is a precious asset to her home, family and children because she can make enlightened decisions. She is an asset to the workplace and community as she can contribute her intelligence equally alongside a male. It is more to do with attitude and mindset of people. It’s our religion too which is misinterpreted that women must be confined only to do some particular assigned works. We really must keep aloof ourselves from certain weird beliefs and cultural connotations as their sole aim is to keep women from attaining their full potential. These are the kind of scenarios where a woman is discouraged from being successful as it would scare off male suitors. It is a common notion that a woman is expected to wait for marriage before she has a life. No! A woman should keep improving and building herself up through educating herself for the betterment of next generation.          ×     Acting Editor: Dr. Khondaker Showkat Hossain  Publisher: Tapash Mazumder (late) 118-121, Tejgaon I/A, Dhaka, BangladeshPolitics National World Education Sports Entertainment    55030001-6 & 55030008        01310550422        [email protected], [email protected], [email protected], [email protected]
