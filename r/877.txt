He was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in human history.Born on the island of Corsica not long after its annexation by the Kingdom of France, Napoleon's modest family descended from minor Italian nobility. He supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica.Show lessRead moreWikipedia6 storiesStoryThe story of Napoleon's Hundred Days, in Épinal printsMusée BertrandStoryGloires Nationales, or National Glories: History in Épinal printsMusée BertrandStoryThe story of Napoleon's rise to power, in Épinal printsMusée BertrandStoryGeneral BertrandMusée BertrandStoryStory of a coronationPalace of VersaillesStoryFollowing in the footsteps of Napoleon I at Les Invalides …    Musée de l'Armée - Hôtel des Invalides Discover this historical figure1,751 itemsOrganize by“Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets.”Napoleon BonaparteAug 15, 1769 - May 5, 1821Translate with GoogleGoogle apps
