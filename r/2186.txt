He arrived after 10 weeks at sea, on 15 October 1815. The small island would harbor Napoleon for the next six years, until his death. He initially stayed at Briars Pavilion before setting up permanent residence at Longwood House, where he died on 5 May 1821.  Longwood House still exists today as a museum, owned by the French government since 1858. It has been painstakingly restored to how it would have looked when the emperor lived there, complete with drawing room, billiard room, private suite and the bedroom where he passed away, aged 51. His tomb also remains on the island although Napoleon’s body was exhumed and repatriated to France in 1840.Tagged in:NapoleonIslasExilioFranciaArmadaItaliaCommentRulesSign in to commentAlready have an accountWe recommend these for you in Latest newsFINANCEHow will the Fed’s decision to keep rates the same affect your money?FOODHow to get free wings at TGI Fridays if you have a busted March Madness bracketFOODWhy is Chips Ahoy! changing its recipe?
