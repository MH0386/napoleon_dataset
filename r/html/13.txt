SIEGE OF QUÃBEC
Opposing Forces
British Army, Americans and Navy The Royal Navy
Since the  task assigned to the army under Wolfe's command was to go up the river to  QuÃ©bec, Wolfe needed a powerful and efficient navy to transport soldiers, food  and ammunition to their destination. The St. Lawrence   River was in fact very difficult to navigate and this alone was a  strong obstacle for any invader to overcome. The Navy also had to back up army  attacks, a task that was brilliantly accomplished in QuÃ©bec.
During the expedition, the British fleet was under  the command of Admiral Charles Saunders. His second in command was Rear Admiral  Philip Durell, and Rear Admiral Charles Holmes was third in command. These men  commanded a fleet of 320 ships, including 49 warships.
