Massiot & cieThe family was descended from Charles-Marie [Carlo] Bonaparte (1746-1785), an advocate in Ajaccio, Corsica, who in 1764 married Maria-Letizia Ramolino (1750-1836). He had inherited the four-story house. Four years after the Bonapartes' marriage, Corsica was ceded by Genoa to become part of metropolitan France; consequently the second of their eight surviving children, Napoleon Bonaparte, became a military cadet in France. Empress Eug\u00E9nie refurbished and expanded the house in 1869 in order to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Napoleon's birth. The house was almost continuously owned by members of the family from 1682 to 1923. In 1967, the house was made into a museum.HistoryAlt TitleCasa BuonaparteDate Created1910-01-01Date Modified2017-06-30Spatial Coverage+41.9179+8.7383|Ajaccio Corsica, France|AjaccioTemporal Coveragebefore or circa 1910Cultural Context['Seventeenth century', 'Nineteenth century', 'Empire']Rights StatementTo view the physical lantern slide, please contact the Architecture Library.Usage metrics            CategoriesNo categories selectedKeywordsArchitectureHousesLicenceCC BY-NC-ND 4.0ExportsSelect an optionRefWorksRefWorksBibTeXBibTeXRef. managerRef. managerEndnoteEndnoteDataCiteDataCiteNLMNLMDCDCHide footerAboutFAQsDepositsAccessIntellectual PropertySubmission AgreementGoverning PoliciesHelpDisclaimerSitemapfigshare. credit for  all  your research.
